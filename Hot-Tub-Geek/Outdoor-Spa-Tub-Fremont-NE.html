<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>
