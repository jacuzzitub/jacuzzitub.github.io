<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety. The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>
<p>If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance. You may not think of a spa as life-changing, but Clarity Spas aren't just any hot tub. Thus, you can consider swimming at the beach instead of swimming in a swimming pool. 6. Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets. The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>
<p>Swim spas are covered by a thick insulated cover and are lined with an insulation of polyurethane, therefore the cost of running the unit is much less than that of a regular pool and, of course, even lower than the cost of operating both a pool and a hot tub. You do need to have the correct measurements if you plan to use one of these kits for building a swim spa or hot tub enclosure with a hot tub cover because all the materials are pre cut to the lengths that you need for the size of gazebo you choose.</p>
