<p>Many people use the word Jacuzzi to describe a hot tub or spa, but in fact they are incorrect as Jacuzzi is a brand name. Playtime is maximised in a Vortex Swim Spa. We also provide a selection of must-have hot tub accessories to complete your spa experience. Over the course of a year, they found six patients who were allergic to PPMS and who had also used this chemical to treat their hot tubs. This happens because when you are sitting in hot water that is circulating around your body it dilates the blood vessels. When buying a hot tub you need to know how many people you want to invite in.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>

<p>Next to chromotherapy, hot tubs can feature built-in sound or aromatherapy systems that, through the use of essential oils or aromatic herbs, have a positive effect on your body and emotional health. Now it is time to enjoy your work, you did good, celebrate in your new hot tub. Hot tubs are usually made of wood, but they can also be made from synthetic wood materials. My husband and I purchased a swim spa from Endless Pools in January this year and are delighted with the outcome.</p>
<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean. Sitting in a sauna bath increases skin temperature, causes the pulse rate to double, and thus, increases blood circulation. Today, Jacuzzi features an expanded luxury tub environment, with four types of therapeutic tubs. Our hot tubs are extremely durable, but should anything go wrong, you won't be left high and dry.</p>
<p>When you start shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, there are a number of issues to bear in mind. Rejoin your partner at the other end to relax and snuggle in the hot tub end complete with seating and water jets. In fact, it gives you a swimming experience, free from turbulence, with a current of up to 19,000 litres per minute. As part of our research we also spoke with a regional representative for Master Spas Kevin Richards explained some of the inside workings of the industry, what to look for, questions to ask and where to purchase a swim spa.</p>

Most hot tubs and spas can accommodate between 4 and 8 people and usually come with a step and cover to keep your hot tub in pristine condition.</p>

Often times, you will hear a hot tub referred to as a jacuzzi. While there are a few things to learn, with a little training and ongoing advice from a reputable retailer it will take just a few minutes per week to keep your swim spa clean and ready to use at any time.</p>
