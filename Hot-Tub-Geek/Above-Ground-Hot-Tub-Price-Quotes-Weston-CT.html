<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>One penis rash (which can also be found elsewhere on the body) that can develop in a hot tub that is not properly clean is called hot tub rash (aka pseudomonas folliculitis). After a busy week, the family wants a small entertainment together and getting into the swim spa is one of the best ways to do so. The H2X is also a great fun center for all the family members. Certain chemicals, such as chlorine and bromine, can kill germs in swim spas, pools and hot tubs as long as proper pH and disinfectant levels are maintained.</p>

Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
