<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Environmental reasons for spa & hot tub odors are due to the build-up of bio-films on spa surfaces and plumbing lines that contribute to the formation of White Water Mold and Pink Slime and all of their odors. Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub owners in the GTA, Kitchener, Barrie and London are provided with a world-class hot tub ownership experience - for life. Jacuzzi pumps and filters for swimming pools are now made by a Canadian company.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment.

Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
