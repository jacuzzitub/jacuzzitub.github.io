<p>At the end of a long day, few things are better than soaking in a bubbly hot tub. If you really love your swim spa or hot tub and want to use it while you are pregnant, you can set the temperature lower, stay in less than 10 minutes, take your temperature, and pay close attention to any feelings of discomfort or sweating.

Vinegar can be used as a cleaning agent for hot tubs and is gentle enough that it will not harm any of the working parts or the tub itself.</p>
