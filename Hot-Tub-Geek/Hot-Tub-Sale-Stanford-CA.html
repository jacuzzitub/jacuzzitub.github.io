I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit.

With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
