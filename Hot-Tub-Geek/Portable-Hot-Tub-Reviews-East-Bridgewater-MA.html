<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced. The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
<p>Men who use their sauna jets for solo time may worry when their female friends come calling, especially since water in a standard tub is changed only a few times each year. This alternative to a pool has benefits for you and your entire family.

<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
<p>Even though the swimming space is smaller than in a regular pool, it is still larger than most swim spas, and you have the option of including swim jets if you want a more intensive swimming experience.
