<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. A system of heaters and jets keep it bubbling, which create satisfying massaging sensation and eventually work as an excellent anecdote to anxiety and stress. Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>
<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct.

<p>Their parts are also generally cheaper to ship and arrive sooner, reducing downtime if there is a problem with the swim spa in the future. Whilst it is possible to produce the spa's jets and other plastic components using a quantity of reused plastics, it is difficult to guarantee their fundamental quality. One of the most popular additional features that people add onto their Jacuzzi bathtubs is an independent heater.</p>
