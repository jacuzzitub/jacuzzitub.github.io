<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Men who use their sauna jets for solo time may worry when their female friends come calling, especially since water in a standard tub is changed only a few times each year. This alternative to a pool has benefits for you and your entire family. When comparing hot tubs it is recommended to ask the hot tub dealer what the name of the parts manufacture as there are only a few manufacture of good quality hot tubs parts.</p>
