<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Hot tubs and swim spas are both significant investments and both can benefit your physical and mental health as well as your social life. Spa hot tubs are designed in collaboration with physiotherapists in order to enable the final clients to enjoy the advantages of hydromassage. Tom Lachocki, PhD, CEO of the US national Swimming Pool Foundation. If you decide to use a hot tub during pregnancy, take precautions and make sure you soak for a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>

<p>Saunas induce sweating, which causes a decrease in the body's toxic load and thereby promotes better health. Next, it is important that you check the pH balance of the water in your jacuzzi style hot tub on a regular basis.
