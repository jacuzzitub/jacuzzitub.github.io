<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water. For example, the first time you use your new tub and try to remove its bulky 7'x7' cover, you will quickly understand the value of a hydraulic cover lifter: a device that makes it a breeze to open and close your cover. There are hot tubs made for only one, and they go up in size from there. The word spa refers to a tub filled with water that has heat for the water and jets to spray the water and circulate it throughout the tub.</p>

To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>

SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>

Also, hot tubs are pretty easy to maintain, which is what you need if it is going to be something you want to relax in.
