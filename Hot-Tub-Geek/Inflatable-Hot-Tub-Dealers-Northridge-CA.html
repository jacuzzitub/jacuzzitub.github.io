<p>Does your spa or hot tub smell? When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration. This means trying out the spa with water in it to see if the seats are comfortable, if the jets are to your liking and if the controls are easy to operate. This hot tub includes a hardtop cover, filters, and curbside delivery from most stores. For beginning swimmer of for anyone looking to improve his or her swimming form, it provides added stability and assistance in maintaining your body position in the current.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>

But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking.
