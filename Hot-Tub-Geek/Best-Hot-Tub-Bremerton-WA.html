<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
