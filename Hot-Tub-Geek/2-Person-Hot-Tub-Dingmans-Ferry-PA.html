<p>If you live in an area with a seasonal swim season, spring is the time to prepare for your pool opening. Some models even have a swim spa and hot tub combo, so you can massage those tired and aching muscles after a morning workout. Most complaints were about walk-in tubs in general rather than Jacuzzi itself. We're concerned with your experience for the life of your Fitness or Exercise System ownership. Here are some easy ways that you can find a leak in your hot tub. Browse through our selection to see different hot tub features that can complete your backyard oasis including specially designed BMW models, salt water system models, a variety of jet styles and amounts, and much more.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>

Completely adjustable current means everyone who uses the swim spa will find the perfect swimming speed.</p>

Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage. Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
<p>When you start shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, there are a number of issues to bear in mind. Rejoin your partner at the other end to relax and snuggle in the hot tub end complete with seating and water jets. In fact, it gives you a swimming experience, free from turbulence, with a current of up to 19,000 litres per minute. As part of our research we also spoke with a regional representative for Master Spas Kevin Richards explained some of the inside workings of the industry, what to look for, questions to ask and where to purchase a swim spa.</p>
<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage. Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>
