<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>If you really love your swim spa or hot tub and want to use it while you are pregnant, you can set the temperature lower, stay in less than 10 minutes, take your temperature, and pay close attention to any feelings of discomfort or sweating.

Vinegar can be used as a cleaning agent for hot tubs and is gentle enough that it will not harm any of the working parts or the tub itself.</p>

The Endless Pools® hydraulically powered underwater treadmill offers low-impact run or walk options. Swim spas are designed for exercise. If you plan to purchase an indoor hot tub, you should consider where you will install it and the people who will use it most often.</p>
<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>
