<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The company's history can be traced back to the mid-20th century when the Jacuzzi brothers invented an underwater pump that could be used to relieve pain in arthritis patients.

<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location.
