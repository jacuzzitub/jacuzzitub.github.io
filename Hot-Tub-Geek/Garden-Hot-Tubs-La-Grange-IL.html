The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>

At Compass Pools Sydney, we are able to offer a range of beautiful inground spas, waders and plunge pools from Compass Pools.
