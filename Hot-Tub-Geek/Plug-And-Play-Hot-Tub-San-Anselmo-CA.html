<h3>Home Hot Tub San Anselmo CA 94960</h3>
<p>In the sea most people spend some time splashing about to cool off as well as swimming, which also has benefits on your health. Compared to a swimming pool a swim spa requires much less space in your home or garden, yet despite the smaller footprint provides even the strongest swimmer a fantastic swimming experiences all year round. At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>
<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
