<p>When you own a hot tub or spa you certainly need to make sure you have some protection for it such as one of the quality spa covers that are available. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa.

If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
