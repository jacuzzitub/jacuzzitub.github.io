<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>

This range features includes: Standard Control Panel, Classic Jets, Classic Foot Massage, 2-Stage Filtration, Multi Coloured Lighting, Comfortable Headrests, Built-in Drink Holders and Classic Waterfall. The Jacuzzi® Hertfordshire showroom is the perfect place to experience the quality & exclusivity of this world famous brand.</p>

Keep in mind that the figures above do not include set up, break down, electricity, water, insurance, commissions, hotel and airfare (for flown in professional sales people).</p>

<h3>Spring Is The Season For Opening A Pool Edison</h3>

<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>
<p>The innovative bowed sidelines of the Kona , Sport and Splash Series are more comfortable than conventional swim spas, creating a more spacious swim area with greater freedom of movement. An Endless Pools® Fitness System and Swim Spa from the makers of Hot Spring® Spas, truly is a versatile option for the backyard. Ultimately, the warranty that a supplier is prepared to offer on their product is the best judge of the quality of the spa and how long you can expect it to last.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>
