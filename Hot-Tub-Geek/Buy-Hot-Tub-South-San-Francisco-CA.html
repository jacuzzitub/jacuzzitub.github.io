<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets.

Whether you're simply too busy or feel outnumbered by your troubles, a personal hot tub is an easy way to find peace and comfort without travelling hundreds of miles away. People who have opted for an exercise pool rather than a standard swimming pool find it is much better for exercise plus the running costs are a fraction of those of a large pool.</p>
<h2>Outdoor Whirlpool Spa South San Francisco California</h2>

If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it. Realize that these style units may be a bit more costly because they need two completely separate filtering, pumping and heating systems.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
<p>In a May 2016 article, LiveScience gives several tips on how to keep kids safe around pools and hot tubs and reduce the risk of drowning. The jacuzzi tub affects the mind and body to feel you refreshing. One of the first steps to opening a pool is removing the pool cover, but before you do so, clean the deck area to prevent debris from being swept into the swimming pool. Please feel free to browse our selection of hot tubs and spas and call us with any questions.</p>
