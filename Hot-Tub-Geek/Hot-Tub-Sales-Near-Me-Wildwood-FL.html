Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

The HL 8DL is a great hot tub to relax in, the Healthy Living 8 Dual Lounge provides reclined seating for two at once, 44 hydrotherapy jets, and LED lighting. But hot tubs are not all the same as one another and the qualifications of their makers differ as well. Most mid-range swim spas are also built with more equipment that is designed for swim spas.</p>

Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this.
