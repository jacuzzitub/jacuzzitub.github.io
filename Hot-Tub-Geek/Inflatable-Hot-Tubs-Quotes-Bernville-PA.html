Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs.

Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
