<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system.

Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
<p>The Endless Pool Swim Spa is a great strength builder. In hotter climates, when other spas will be unbearable, your Vortex spa will be an oasis of cool water to refresh and recharge. Aquatic exercise in an exercise pool gives all the benefits of land-based aerobic workouts, but keeps your body cool and comfortable and no impact injury potential. The International Swimming Federation or the Federation Internationale de la Natation (FINA) sets the standards for competition pools.</p>
