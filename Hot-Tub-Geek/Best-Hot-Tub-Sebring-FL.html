They are slightly larger than traditional bathtubs and have features similar to fiberglass whirlpools. Besides those benefits, swimming spas can also help your heart and lungs. As the name itself suggest, you could take portable hot tubs with you when you decide to relocate.</p>
<p>At that point in time, the Swim Spa did not really seem like such a great bargain. We have a large variety of hot tubs for sale. Some people prefer water temperatures to be at about body temperature of about 98.6. When someone who reacts badly to very hot water gets in a too hot spa they may have a heat stroke. You can find the same benefits of hot tubs in swim spas. Finding the best hot tubs for sale doesn't have to be difficult.</p>
<p>One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas.
