<p>Does your spa or hot tub smell? When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration.

<p>With the combination of heat and humidity, and water - your body is more than likely losing water while swimming.

<p>For the most part, swim spas costing between $10,000 and $20,000 are built with cost rather than quality in mind.
