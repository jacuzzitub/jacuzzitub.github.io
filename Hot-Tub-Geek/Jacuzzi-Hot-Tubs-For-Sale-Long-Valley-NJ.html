<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>After all, Endless Pools pioneered propeller-driven swim-in-place technology in 1988 and has remained the industry-leader for nearly 30 years. When asked What is the largest swim spa?” we tell customers that Hydropool has two of the largest swim spas available on the market. The photo to the left shows the swimming end of the Swim Spa. Just be sure that you can access any of the hot tub workings that you may need to at any time.</p>

SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas. A sauna bath feels therapeutic, but may be a bit too warm for the testicles, and men who regularly spend time in hot tubs may have low fertility rates as a result. Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option.

If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it.
