<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>

It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<p>Always keep an eye on your child while they are near water, even if they aren't swimming. We Know Hot Tubs. You can have self-contained and "portable" unit, you can just get a Swim Spa shell and set it into a deck, you can have a customized Swim spa made for you or you can get a Swim Spa Water Jet and install it into your existing above ground or inground swimming pool.
