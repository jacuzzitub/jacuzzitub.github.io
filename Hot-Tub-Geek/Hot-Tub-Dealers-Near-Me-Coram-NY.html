<p>When considering the purchase of a hot tub, the price is not the only factor that you should take into consideration. After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body. Also the green view is one that is very much listened to by the hot tub industry resulting in much more ecological friendly Hot Tubs. By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace.

We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
<p>There are many different benefits associated with using Jacuzzi hot tubs for hydrotherapy. This is why swim spas are particularly popular in Australian cities, where land is at a premium and blocks tend to be small.

<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well. These centers usually have more than one pool which caters to guests of different swimming requirements.
