<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Originated in 1970 as a commercial swimming pool company and in 1978 became one of the first hot tub retailers in North America. In tune with advanced market developments, we are providing Bathtub Repair Service. Some walk-in tubs feature heated seats to help the bather stay warm while waiting for the tub to fill and drain. If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>
<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>

The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours.
