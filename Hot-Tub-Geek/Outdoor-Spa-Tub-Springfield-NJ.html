<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>In most cases, these swim spas cost less an $2.00 a day to operate. If you ever had a chance to relax in a Jacuzzi tub, you must know what it can do to help your mind and body. Of course, the Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. After an active day on the slopes, it is worth relaxing at the hotel's wellness centre with an indoor swimming pool, Jacuzzi and sauna. The warm, small body of water can be a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.</p>
