<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs. These smaller sized swim spas can still accommodate several bathers, although if you're taller than average it might feel a little small. Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>
<p>In this part of your swim spa, internal turbines create a current you can swim against, just as you would if you swam in the ocean tide; this gives you the optimal exercise of swimming as a form of strength training in a small, efficient area.

These lightweight and robustly constructed tubs are provided with air switch, hand shower, golf waterfall and dream pillow.</p>

Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom.
