Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs.

<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
