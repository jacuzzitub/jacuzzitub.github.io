<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling.

<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>The therapy depends on the movement of water for a massage, buoyancy and the laminar current for relaxing your muscles, and the right temperature to offer a wholesome experience. Jacuzzi tubs can also be extremely noisy when in use. In fact, the only tool you will need to install your very own swimming pool is a screwdriver.

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
