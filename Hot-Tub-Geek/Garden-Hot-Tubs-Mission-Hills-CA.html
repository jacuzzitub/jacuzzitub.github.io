<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. Fully adjustable current for swimming in place so you can focus on your form and never have to turn or push off a wall again. Late evenings or weekends may be times when the family can catch a few minutes together relaxing in the hot tub or spa.

Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
