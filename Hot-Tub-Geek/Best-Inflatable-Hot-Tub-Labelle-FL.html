The power requirements of these tubs enable the massage jets to function effectively. Some destination spas also offer to plan the stay's itinerary so all you have to do is be there and get pampered.</p>

Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
