The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit.

Sitting in a body of water that is warmer than your body's temperature will raise your temperature, whether it's a bath, hot springs, or hot tub.</p>
<p>Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Quality tubs start at about $1,500, but depending on the added amenities, prices can climb as high as $5,000 or $6,000. Jacuzzi's Whisper technology features a patented pump mount system that absorbs half of the vibrations and cuts the tub's heating and pump systems sounds in half. You can spend some time with your loved ones in this stress-free environment where you can relax together and catch up. Trying to swim spas with your close family members or friends could be fun and a new experience that will help you get closer to each other.</p>
