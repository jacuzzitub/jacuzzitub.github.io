Even though the current is strong, it will never come between you and your swim laps and workouts due to the consistency of the water flow that will never let you hit the end of the spa.</p>
<p>The Endless Pool Swim Spa is a great strength builder. In hotter climates, when other spas will be unbearable, your Vortex spa will be an oasis of cool water to refresh and recharge.
