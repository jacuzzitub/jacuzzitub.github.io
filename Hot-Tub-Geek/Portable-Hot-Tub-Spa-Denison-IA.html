<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period. Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>So hot tubs are really nothing new but they have evolved tremendous amounts. Our swim pools offer our attractive styles that are visually appealing for any backyard environment.
