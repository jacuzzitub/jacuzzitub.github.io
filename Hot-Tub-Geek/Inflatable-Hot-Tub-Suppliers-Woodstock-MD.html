<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>

<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>With some minor reconstruction of the bathroom design, even older homes can take advantage of this concept bathtub to open up the room and give a more meditative soak. Infrared home saunas, however, create a sauna environment within a wooden box or even an open space while the heaters create the actual heating effect. With the current's five speeds, the whole family can meet their wellness goals with rowing, resistance exercise, swimming, and relaxing hydrotherapy.</p>
