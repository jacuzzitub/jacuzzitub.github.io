<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>The IX Jet merges maximum airflow with high-output LED lighting, sending multicolored champagne-like bubbles from the bottom of the hot tub to the surface. Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs Ontario has made your dream a reality with the Jacuzzi for Life program Jacuzzi for Life is an exclusive customer program and is the only one of its kind in the entire industry. At that time you could get a pretty nice portable hot tub for about $4000 and a fairly well equipped inground pool for around $25,000.</p>

<p>Popular pump brands include Waterway pumps, Ultra Jet, Vico, Master Series and Hayward. However, Vortex have pioneered it's use in spa pools. There are some disadvantages of swim spas that you should be aware of before deciding on getting one. Made from high-quality materials, these tubs are also chemically inert and nonporous. This is especially so for internet based spas that are sold on price and know that by the time you try it out it is too late to change your mind.</p>
