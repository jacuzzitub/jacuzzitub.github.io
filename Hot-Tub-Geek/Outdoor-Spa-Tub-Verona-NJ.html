Your time with us in the Canberra show room was not only educational to operating a spa, but also the benefits in purchasing a Spa World spa.

Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel.

Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>The water hot temperature, the massage made by swiveling water jets and the ergonomic shape of the hot tub bring down the body tension and soothe your muscles. Swim spas with paddlewheels are the most expensive design and usually cost $35,000 or more, but offer an excellent current to swim against. Swim spas are moderately-sized jetted tubs.
