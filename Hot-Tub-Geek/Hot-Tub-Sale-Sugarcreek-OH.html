Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>

Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage. Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
<p>These help to make your workout more intensive by offering more resistance in the water, so you are basically swimming the equivalent of a long distance within a relatively small space.
