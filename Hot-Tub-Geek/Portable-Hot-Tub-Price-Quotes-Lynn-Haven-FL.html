<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
<p>Great for aching muscles or a sore back, the calming heat of a spa combined with jets for massage is the cure to any bad week. The ALL NEW Premium swim spa line was created to improve the quality of life for you and your family. Perimeter lighting with 15-20 single LED's around the water line of the spa or swim spa. Here we take a look at the swim spa in detail, and answer all your questions so you can make an informed decision about the best pool type for you.</p>
