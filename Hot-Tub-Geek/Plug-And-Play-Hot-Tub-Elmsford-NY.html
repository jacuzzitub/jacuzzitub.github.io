<p>Today, hot tubs are more popular than ever and the number of hot tub owners is steadily rising.

<p>Note: With the exception of Hydropool's Self-Cleaning swim spas , almost all mid-range and high-end swim spas still utilize hot tub filtration systems, despite using other specialized swim spas parts such as pumps and jets.

It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.
