<p>Every time summer comes, people start getting restless and try to finds ways to beat the heat. One of the best forms of all round exercise is swimming, an all year exercise that can be enjoyed in the pool, in the sea or in a lake or river.

The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
