<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks. And because swim spas are usually larger than normal spa pools you have more room for relaxing or more room for family and friends. They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not about anxiety, it might be that maybe you can't find any good nearby pools or any pools at all. Chlorine and bromine are among the chemicals used to control bacterial growth in hot tub water.

<p>A hot tub used to be seen as a luxury item that people could only dream of owning one day. But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes. Staying fit and living well is easy with the Vitality Series Fitness Spas, pleasing both your wellness goals and budget.</p>

This type of hot tub is located in the privacy of your home so it is only viewable to people you are already comfortable with.
