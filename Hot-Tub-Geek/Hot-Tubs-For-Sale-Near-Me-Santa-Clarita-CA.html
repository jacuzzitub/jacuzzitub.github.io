<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>There are seven base swim spa models to customize at Arctic Spas: Hudson, Kingfisher, Wolverine, Ocean, Athabascan and Okanagan.

For most people, swim spas are still a relatively new concept. RELAX AND UNWIND IN HOT TUB MODE BY REDIRECTING THE WATER JETS FOR AN OPTIMAL HOT TUB EXPERIENCE.

<p>The extraordinary swim current generator has helped over 20,000 swimmers of all skill levels experience the many benefits of aquatic fitness.

Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs. For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>

But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes.
