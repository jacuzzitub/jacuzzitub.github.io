<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>

You would usually work your entire backyard around a dedicated swimming pool area, but a swim spa will fit into a much smaller backyard or outdoor alfresco area.</p>
<p>The offered acrylic bathtub is designed from the best material & latest technology in accordance with the norms of market. This is even more important if you don't plan on using the bathtub again for several days. An electric heater can also be installed for enjoying hot whirling water in Jacuzzi.

<p>Swim spas vary dramatically in cost depending on size, jet power, features and installation. They have this feature wherein an adjustable water current will be applied in the pool part so you can swim laps and laps without hitting the walls nor turning around. Get all these things right and you will never regret buying a Jacuzzi tub, so seek professional help when selecting a hot tub for your home - you can often try them out at the dealers shop too.</p>
