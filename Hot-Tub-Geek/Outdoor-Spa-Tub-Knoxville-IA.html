<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>

<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>

The quiet-operating 2-speed pump works continuously to filter 100% of the spa's water for 24 hours a day. Have your tired feet massaged by tingling and pulsating hot water action.</p>
<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget.

<p>When shopping for coverage, be sure that you mention the hot tub to make sure a provider will cover a property with a hot tub. For all swimming pools, insert removable skimmer baskets to catch large debris before entering into the filtration system. When this is done it takes forever for the tub to warm up due to very little amount of power flowing through the heating elements, I do not recommend this way of installation for the large units.</p>
<p>Proper swimming pool maintenance can prevent common problems such as green pool water, cloudy water, pool staining, itchy eyes, pungent chlorine smell and the spread of various waterborne diseases. The simple fact that SwimLife Swimspas accommodate more functionality than similar-sized competitive models.

<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>In fact, most larger swim spas will even have a separate section that mimics a hot tub, offering a dual-purpose experience. Many agree that having a Jacuzzi walk-in tub has noticeably improved their quality of life. Their Simple hot tub Care®, system is an easy-to-follow program that is simple to use, but does for your hot tub exactly what needs to be done. Swim spas have it all—aquatic exercise, relaxation and fun for all ages from the comforts, privacy and convenience of home.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
