<p>There are different types of swimming pools and they are named based on their usage. Whether it's a more affordable model you seek or a swim spa with extras - like a built-in LCD TV screen and ice bucket perfect for keeping refreshments cold - we welcome you to come to our showroom and browse our excellent options available in swim spas. The smaller volume of water is less maintenance to keep clean and swimming pools can't typically provide hot water for use throughout the colder months of winter.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>

<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>The luxury hotel offers a Jacuzzi in every bathroom. A quality spa pool will always use one of these two processes. There is probably no better way to enjoy your home environment with the people you love the most, than sharing the fun with some wonderful swim spa activities. And then there are the independent hot tub sales events which are not only paying thousands for their space and everything else mentioned above for a three-day event…but they have extremely high costs for their aggressive TV advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation. The Hydrozone Pro has two powerful swim jets and three pumps, while the Pro Plus has three swim jets and four pumps and the Hydrozone Extreme is the ultimate with four powerful swim jets and five pumps. Three primary actions are important for maintaining the water in your Hot Tub in tip-top shape.</p>

<p>Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year. Soaking in your hot tub can be a true panacea for your health. Swim spas have this feature wherein you can swim in place for as long as you want.</p>

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>

<p>These help to make your workout more intensive by offering more resistance in the water, so you are basically swimming the equivalent of a long distance within a relatively small space. At the same time, the price of swimming pools rose greatly as well….partially due to advances in technology and features, and partly due to the increased price of installation and insurance that pool builders had to pay.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
