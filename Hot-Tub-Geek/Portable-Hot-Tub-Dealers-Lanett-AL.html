<p>Hot tubs and swim spas are both significant investments and both can benefit your physical and mental health as well as your social life. Spa hot tubs are designed in collaboration with physiotherapists in order to enable the final clients to enjoy the advantages of hydromassage. Tom Lachocki, PhD, CEO of the US national Swimming Pool Foundation. If you decide to use a hot tub during pregnancy, take precautions and make sure you soak for a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use.

<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
