<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool.

The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>
