The pump within your spa pool determines the overall quality and functioning of your whole spa.</p>

By taking the added stress of maintenance, repairs and replacement out of owning a hot tub, Jacuzzi for Life provides customers in Hamilton, Burlington and surrounding areas with the best experience available on the market.

It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.
