<p>Perhaps one may want to enjoy and own your very own Hot Tub but you are just not able to justify the cost of a brand new one. Only the Swim Spa WaterWatch® tracks distance and monitors performance, heart rate, calories and more while offering real time results and feedback. With a Coast Spas Wellness Spa® you'll sleep and feel better, increase your fitness and stamina, elevate your mood as well as lower your blood pressure.
