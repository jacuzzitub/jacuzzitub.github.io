There are some disadvantages of swim spas that you should be aware of before deciding on getting one. Made from high-quality materials, these tubs are also chemically inert and nonporous.

This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>
