<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Jets - Some Hydro Massage Jets would be a very good idea to introduce the water into the Hot Tub and here I would suggest not those simple bullet hole type that are un adjustable and are merely copied from decades ago but those that are fully adjustable. Blood pressure is balanced, people with diabetes has their blood sugar levels reduced, people can sleep better, headaches and minor body pains are taken away, and much more can happen with a regular soak in a tub.</p>
