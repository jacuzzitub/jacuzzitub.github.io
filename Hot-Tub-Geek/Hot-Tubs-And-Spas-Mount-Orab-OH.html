<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
