<p>Many people use the word Jacuzzi to describe a hot tub or spa, but in fact they are incorrect as Jacuzzi is a brand name. Exercise isn't the only pastime when there's a swim spa at home. With all commercial hot tubs found in hotels, gyms and health clubs they are mandatory to list the full set of safely points next to the hot tubs for all users to read. Among the latest trends on the market swim spas are taking hold; They allow to swim even in small-sized tubs and even to work out in the water and then relax with a hydro therapeutic massage.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>
