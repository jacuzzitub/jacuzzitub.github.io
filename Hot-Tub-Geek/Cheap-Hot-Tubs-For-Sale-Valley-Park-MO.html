<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>One-piece hot tubs are popular because their manufacturing cost is lower than the wooden hot tubs. Size - With most swimming pools starting at a size of 18x36', they can take up a significant amount of our space. Fiberglass whirlpools have high pressure 'jets' that create a whirlpool effect. This hot tub was the perfect balance of cost and quality. Simply put, high-end swim spas offer the best swimming experience available.</p>

<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>You are going to want to invest a bit of energy in putting it away where it is free from accumulation of dust and particles so that you experience a more comfortable spa session each time you use it. The number of motors and pumps is in direct relation to the actual size of the Hot Tub the number of jets and the degree of therapy delivered.
