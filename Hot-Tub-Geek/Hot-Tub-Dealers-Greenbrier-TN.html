<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub. Now, this was fine for a number of years until, of course, spas started springing up in hotels and sports complexes and going to the spa” (yah!) just like the Romans did became cool again. Go for a more powerful spa pump if you have a bigger jacuzzi or the pressure of water in your area is relatively lower. After hitting the slopes in Irownwood, use your hot tub to aid in repairing sore muscles and injuries. Hotel Spas - These are the same as the above the only difference would be it may come in with your all inclusive package where you would get unlimited treatment, drinks and food.</p>

One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>

Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side.
