<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>The hot water in a spa helps keep your blood circulating better. Every so often, it is a good idea to consider adding a water sparkle agent to keep your hot tub looking bright and clear. Hotels are famous for advertising an in-room Jacuzzi, when it's actually a spa made by some other manufacturer. By reducing the temperature drop required before the heater switches on, Reactive Heater Control provides more consistent spa water temperatures and lowers your daily operating costs.</p>
