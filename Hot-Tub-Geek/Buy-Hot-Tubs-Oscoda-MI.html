<p>Saunas induce sweating, which causes a decrease in the body's toxic load and thereby promotes better health.

Some of these are heated in the traditional way with wood fires and there are some companies that rent them out and run experience days where you can use traditional hot tubs in the peace and tranquillity of unspoilt woodland and other open spaces.</p>
