<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system.

Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>
