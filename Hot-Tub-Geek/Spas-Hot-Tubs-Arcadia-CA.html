With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one.

Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>You should always have the cover on it when the tub is not in not only keeps the water warm but also keeps the dirt and dust out. Although the words hot tub” and spa” can refer to the same thing here in the U.S., many parts of the world use the word spa” to refer to natural mineral springs. Most hot tubs and spas can accommodate between 4 and 8 people and usually come with a step and cover to keep your hot tub in pristine condition.</p>

<p>The Following Atlantic City hotels features Jacuzzis, some are included in every room and a few hotels have specific room types that contain the Jacuzzi experience. The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets. One method is to time a "stroke cycle", starting a watch when the swimmer's right arm enters the water and stopping the watch when the right arm re-enters the water. In the 1980s, swim spas were invented, yet they didn't come popular until the last decade.</p>
