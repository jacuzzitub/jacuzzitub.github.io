Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect.

Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel.

Once you have a sense of the type and size of hot tub that works best for you, it's also worth considering other factors that will make your experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs.
