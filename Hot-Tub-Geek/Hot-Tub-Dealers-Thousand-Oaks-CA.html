<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets. If there is dealer does not know the name of what parts are used in their hot tub or it's a name you have not heard of it best to keep clear of their particular tubs.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced. The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>

Jacuzzi manufacturers their tubs in Valdosta, Georgia so you know your tub will meet U.S. standards and license requirements. So I say why stop at the swimming lessons, if people are coming to your swimming pool for rehabilitation and relaxation: supplement your swim pool environment with music.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
