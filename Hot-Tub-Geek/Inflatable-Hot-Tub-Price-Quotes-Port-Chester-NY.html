If the spa you are considering does not offer this it is likely a sign that they have not used quality products in the manufacturing of their jets. But if you are willing to put up with cheaper construction, a less powerful motor, and higher lifetime heating costs, the difference in purchase price between the two hot tubs might make buying the less expensive one a perfectly reasonable decision.</p>

Some destination spas also offer to plan the stay's itinerary so all you have to do is be there and get pampered.</p>
