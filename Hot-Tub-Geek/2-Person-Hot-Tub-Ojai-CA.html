<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>

<p>After reviewing several portable hot tubs, we decided the Lay-Z Spa Miami was the one we would purchase. If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa. Whether you decided on the built-in model or installing a swim spa in your garden, the cost of installation is much less than constructing an in-ground swimming pool that requires a lot of labor work to get done.</p>
