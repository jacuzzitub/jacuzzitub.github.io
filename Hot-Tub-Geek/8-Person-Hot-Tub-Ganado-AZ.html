<p>Hot tubs serve their purpose well in reducing stress and muscle tension from our body-from an adult body used to extreme temperatures. The hotel facility includes an indoor swimming pool, a whirlpool , a sauna, massages, a children's playground and free parking. Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference. The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
