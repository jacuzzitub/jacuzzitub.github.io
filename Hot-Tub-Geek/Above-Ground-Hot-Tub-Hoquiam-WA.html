<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>After all, Endless Pools pioneered propeller-driven swim-in-place technology in 1988 and has remained the industry-leader for nearly 30 years.

<p>Muscle pain and stiffness cannot remain in your body when the hot, high speed water surrounds you.

<p>One penis rash (which can also be found elsewhere on the body) that can develop in a hot tub that is not properly clean is called hot tub rash (aka pseudomonas folliculitis). After a busy week, the family wants a small entertainment together and getting into the swim spa is one of the best ways to do so. The H2X is also a great fun center for all the family members. Certain chemicals, such as chlorine and bromine, can kill germs in swim spas, pools and hot tubs as long as proper pH and disinfectant levels are maintained.</p>

Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>
