This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
