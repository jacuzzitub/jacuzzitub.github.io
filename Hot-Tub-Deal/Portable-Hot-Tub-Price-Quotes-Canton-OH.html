  <meta name="description" content="Sundance Spas in Canton Ohio - Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room.">
