<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks. And because swim spas are usually larger than normal spa pools you have more room for relaxing or more room for family and friends. They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>They find SwimLife swimspas the ultimate answer to satify all their needs and answer the demand for more for their money. SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas.

Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
