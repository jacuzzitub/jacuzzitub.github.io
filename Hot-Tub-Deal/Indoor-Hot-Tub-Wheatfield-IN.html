<h3>Swimlife SwimExpert Swim Spas Wheatfield</h3>
<p>Water remains calm in a swimming pool, which can encourage walking or standing over a more active swimming experience. Just outside the back door, you can have an amazing temperature controlled pool and hot tub in one - the perfect space for light aquatic exercise followed by rejuvenation and allover relaxation. If the hot water jets are on, sit on the opposite side where the water temperature is slightly lower.</p>
<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
<p>The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
<p>It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
