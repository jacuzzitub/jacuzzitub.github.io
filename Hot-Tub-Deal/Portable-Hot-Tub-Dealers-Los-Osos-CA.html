<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>

You should also consider a location that will minimize the mess of water, because an indoor hot tub makes it easier to get out of the tub and walk through the rest of the house before drying off. You can customize most swim spas with steps, an ozone or bromine filtration system, cover or various colors of internal shells and external cabinet.</p>
