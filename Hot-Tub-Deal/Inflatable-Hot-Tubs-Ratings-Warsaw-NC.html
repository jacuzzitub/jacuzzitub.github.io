Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy.
