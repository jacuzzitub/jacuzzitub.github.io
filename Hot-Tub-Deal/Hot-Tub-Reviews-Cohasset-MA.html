<p>You can still by spas and hot tubs under the Jacuzzi name. For example, a 60-gallon tub would require a 40-gallon water heater. As explained above, in the ‘What is the best filtration system for your spa pool” section, there are three main types of pumps, two-speed, single speed jet and single speed circulation. Unlike any other quality of hose, this particular PVC piping has the ability to withstand the spa pool environment of temperatures between -26 and +70 degrees Celsius.</p>
