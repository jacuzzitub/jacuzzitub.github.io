<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi.

Each seat is tactically fitted with various types of massage jets in different positions, mounted in a way to massage every part of the body.</p>
