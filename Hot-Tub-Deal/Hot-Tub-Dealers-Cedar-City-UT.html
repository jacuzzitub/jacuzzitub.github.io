<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
