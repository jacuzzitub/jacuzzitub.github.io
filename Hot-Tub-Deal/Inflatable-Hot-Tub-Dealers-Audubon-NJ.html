<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>Exercise in general will increase the amount of air taken into the lungs, but swimming in particular can make a big impact. I would recommend Spa World (especially their swim spa range) to anyone that is weighing between a spa and a pool. With three airless jets, comfortable seating for the whole family, 27 hydromassage jets, and generous recreation space, harmony between work and play is possible. All Jacuzzi® brand bathtubs are made from the highest quality acrylic.</p>

If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it.

<h3>Spring Is The Season For Opening A Pool Audubon</h3>
<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>
<p>This new and innovative way to take your swim spa cover on and off makes swim spa sessions easier than ever. Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features. For the ultimate in relaxation, a whirlpool bath is absolutely ideal for easing muscle tension & improving blood circulation, and now it's even easier to upgrade than ever. Be sure when ordering an Aqua Flow Viton seal kit that it will match the pump used in your Cal Spa, Marquis, Clearwater, Coleman or other spa brand that from time to time has used Aqua Flo pumps in their spas.</p>
