<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. Many of our customers have commented that since owning a swim spa it has reduced the amount of screen time their kids want and increased their physical activity. Come in and see our line of quality swim spas. Spa pools sit well on outdoor decked areas that flow comfortably off your house. For nearly thirty years, Endless Pools has been the top choice has been the top choice of people from casual swimmers to professional athletes all seeking an attractive alternative to in-ground pools or bulky home exercise equipment.</p>
<p>For example, people with multiple sclerosis should avoid a swim spa because warm water can exacerbate symptoms, while people with arthritis tend to prefer a pool that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>The Jacuzzi can be enjoyed at any time of the year, that is for a full 365 days, perhaps to cool off on a warm sultry day or to warm up on a winters evening.
