<p>Today, hot tubs are more popular than ever and the number of hot tub owners is steadily rising. The therapy depends on the movement of water for a massage, buoyancy and the laminar current for relaxing your muscles, and the right temperature to offer a wholesome experience.

<p>With regular workouts lasting a reasonable amount of time (no, five minutes is not going to cut it), the body's compensation for the lack of lung capacity underwater will in turn increase capacity on dry land. While typically installed on a patio, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can be installed indoors in a converted garage or with new construction.

Our research shows PDC Spas is the best place to buy a swim spa because of its large selection, strong swim current systems, quick customer service and many fun options.

<p>Because they use a heavy gauge vinyl liner inside the steel wall panels (just like a standard steel wall inground swimming pool), you are not constrained by a mold. PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization.
