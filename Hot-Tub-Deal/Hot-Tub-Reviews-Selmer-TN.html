Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>
