<p>The Endless Pool Swim Spa is a great strength builder. In hotter climates, when other spas will be unbearable, your Vortex spa will be an oasis of cool water to refresh and recharge.

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range.
