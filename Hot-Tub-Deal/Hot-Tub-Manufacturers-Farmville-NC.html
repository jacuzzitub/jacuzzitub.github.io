<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa.

Here, we have collected 10 more reasons why you might need a swim spa.</p>
<h3>Best Jacuzzi Tub Supplier In Farmville</h3>
<p>When you put Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment in your backyard, you trust its performance. Jacuzzi Pure Air tubs range from a bubbly champagne-like experience to a steadier stream of bubbles, depending entirely on the setting chosen by the user. Typically swim spas are generally about 12 to 24 feet in length. Taking a bath in the Spa Jacuzzi bathtub is a great way to enjoy and release stress after a long day at work.</p>
<p>For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks.

They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>Whether you want a hot tub for two to three people, six to seven, or somewhere in between, you'll find the perfect balance between size, seating, and cost in a J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tub. Paradise Swimming Pools at the Northbrook & Frankfort locations feature a hot tub attached to the pool. People who use a swim spa to get fit and stay fit using aquatic exercise find that they actually make greater progress faster using an exercise pool than on ground.</p>
<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>

Swim Spas are the professional athlete's choice when selecting a swimming pool, and can form an important part of the day-to-day fitness regime of anyone who wants to stay in good shape. Chemicals used to clean and disinfect hot tubs may cause allergic reactions in some people. With three airless swim jets, seating for the family, spa seats with 27 hydromassage jets and plenty of room to move, the R120 sets a new benchmark for quality and value.</p>
