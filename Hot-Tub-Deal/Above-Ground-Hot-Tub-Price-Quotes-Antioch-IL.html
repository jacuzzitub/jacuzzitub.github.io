<p>Hot Tubs from the east usually have every accessory but not the one they really need a Skip!. This rules out family swimming sessions and water games. These covers come in 6 colors, are designed to fit most Swim Spas, and are durable and long lasting. The calcium can also build up on the sensors of the Hot Tub that regulate and deal with temperature and water flow, which can cause problems later.
