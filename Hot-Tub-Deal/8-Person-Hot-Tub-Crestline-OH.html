<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. People can ask the hot tub operator if the disinfectant and pH levels are checked at least twice a day. The need of Indian families for small spa with swimming facility was felt long so Arrdev have come up with swim spa which is suitable for the small space and can be accommodated in just 100 sqft (10 sqmeter). Clearwater Spas warrants their spa shell interior surface against blistering, cracking and delamination for 10 years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
