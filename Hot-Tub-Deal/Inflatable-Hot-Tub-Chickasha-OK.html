<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>

<p>As always when making a major purchase, however, it is essential to do your research and check that you are purchasing a good quality swim spa which will last a long time and be safe to use. Chlorine and bromine are both excellent sanitizers used in spas and hot tubs. Indoor hot tubs eliminate the awkwardness of using the tub in front of neighbors or passersby. Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>

<h3>The Hot And Wet Spa Essential For The Swinging Set Chickasha</h3>
<p>In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight.

In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.
