<p>The massage is conducted by placing heated stones on the skin along the spine or on the chakras. Corner bathtubs also have a place in smaller homes and buildings. Spa systems (or air systems) are slightly different to a whirlpool bath in that they don't use water through the jets, but air. This is an Endless Pools Swimming Pool.
