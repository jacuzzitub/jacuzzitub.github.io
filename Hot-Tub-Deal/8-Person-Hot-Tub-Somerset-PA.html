<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The circuit breaker can also trip if there is a problem with the ozonator or air blower of your hot tub. SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot.

<p>Affordable to buy and to operate, J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are available in several different sizes and configurations. Before you buy a hot tub for your backyard or step into those warm waters at the spa or gym, make sure you know a bit about their safety.

If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it. Realize that these style units may be a bit more costly because they need two completely separate filtering, pumping and heating systems.</p>
<p>Modern Hot Tubs will use a manifold plumbing system in order to ensure efficiency in the plumbing and this helps keep the operating noise to a minimum.

Programmable sleep timers - This function gives you the control to turn your spa off completely for the duration of the night, avoiding any sleep disturbances for family or neighbors.</p>
