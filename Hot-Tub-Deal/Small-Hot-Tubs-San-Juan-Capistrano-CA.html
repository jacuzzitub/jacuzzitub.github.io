Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
