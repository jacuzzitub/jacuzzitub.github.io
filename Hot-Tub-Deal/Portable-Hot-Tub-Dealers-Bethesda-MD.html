<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>

<p>The benefits of swimming are well known. Next is Spa Pack to hot tub. Swim spas do enable you to enjoy swimming and hydrotherapy in even a relatively small backyard. Design, Wellbeing, Performance and Care: these are the values that constituted the essence of JacuzziÂ®, a brand that anticipates needs and trends, creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet requests of any kind.

<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating.

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming.
