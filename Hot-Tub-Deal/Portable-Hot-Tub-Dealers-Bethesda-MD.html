<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours.
