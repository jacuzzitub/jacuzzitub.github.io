Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub.

<p>Not only is this warm air recycled and used to warm the water in your jets, but it also helps to maintain the water temperature and thus saves energy and indeed the user money as it will help to reduce the electricity used.
