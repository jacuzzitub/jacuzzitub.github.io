<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets.

This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>

Warm water also brings down swelling and loosens tight muscles. Indoor hot tubs come in a variety of shapes and colors to match your bathroom decor.

Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>Don't forget that apart from the initial purchase expense, there will be monthly expenses for maintaining Jacuzzi tubs Those expenses will be the electricity to keep the water at the right temperature, chemicals to keep the ph levels safe and water to keep it at the right level. The Hydrozone has comfortable seating for the entire family, up to 68 jets, up to four high volume swim jets and 5 pumps. I had been swimming regularly at a public pool and found it crowded and chemically distasteful.</p>
<p>The American Bath Factory Champagne Jester Jetted Rolltop is a great example of the functionality of jetted bathtubs. Instead of seating, they have strong water jets that create a current strong enough for you to swim against. Nevertheless, it's a cost that must be considered before purchasing a new whirlpool Jacuzzi tub. Also you should be aware that Modern Hot Tubs have progressed by leaps and bounds in their use of Heat efficient technology.</p>

The brand is known for their innovation, holding more than 250 patents for their state-of-the-art hydrotherapy features ranging from water purification to jet capabilities. Emerging yourself into the warm waters of a Hot Tub or Spa can actually help your health. It doesn't hurt to sit in a bathtub of hot water because your upper body generally is not fully submerged and the materials used to build tubs cool the water quickly, unlike swim spa materials and systems.</p>
<p>Full width joint insulator - This component involves a compressible tube of insulation sits on the join of the spa cover. Swim spas and hot tubs often carry similar price tags. The hot moving water in the Jacuzzi soothes your muscles. This jet driven swim spa is one of the largest and most powerful on the market while providing the space and functionality for an entire family. It is a whole lot easier to climb into a hot tub than it is to pull yourself out over the slippery water filled sides so that cover will help prevent any sort of accident if you leave it open and unattended.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
