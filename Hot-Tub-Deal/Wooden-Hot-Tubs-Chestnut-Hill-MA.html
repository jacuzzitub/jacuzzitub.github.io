<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>

Jacuzzi's Espree collection features curves specifically designed to contour around the body's natural curves. There's small hot tubs are ideal for people that wish to have a hot tub, but do not want a huge hot tub due to them not having room in the garden or just feel they do not have the need for a larger hot tub, as only every 2 people will be using the hot tub.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
