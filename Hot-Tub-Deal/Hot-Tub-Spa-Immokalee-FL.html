<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>

<p>If you want an inground swim spa installed, you can expect to pay more than these prices, as there is so much extra work involved in installing any pool inground. In many areas you can also commission hot tubs and install wooden swimming pools. Quarrycast is a mineral crystal composite, a new material developed by Victoria & Albert Baths, to enhance your bathing experience: it's warm to the touch, keeping the water in your hot tub hot for a long time; it has a naturally high gloss finish and it can be colored with the dye of your choice, maximizing the interior design options in your bathroom.</p>
