The swimming pool alternative for any backyard.

<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced.

<p>In terms of price, portable hot tubs are more affordable than regular hot tubs. This allows a person, or pet, to soak in warm, relaxing water, while still swimming and exercising against a legitimate current and with plenty of space.
