<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. If you want to improve your fitness, relieve pressure on your body or melt away the stresses of daily life, an Endless Pools Swim Spa is the intelligent option. It is true that athletes can exercise, relieve muscle tension and improve their over all athletic performance through the use of a swimming pool and spa. Because of their flexible designs, modern hot tubs can be used in a multitude of settings. Many articles and clinics cover the intricacies of how this can be improved however; stroke rate or tempo is of equal importance for faster swimming.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents.

With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps.
