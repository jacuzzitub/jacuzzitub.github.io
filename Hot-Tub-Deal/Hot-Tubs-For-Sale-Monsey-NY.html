<p>You will find that there are many manufacturers of bath tubs on the market today but only one name really stands above the rest. We'll describe the average swim spa and compare that with both of the largest Hydropool models in the article below. Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa. Many times, people who choose swim spas are looking to avoid paying more for a swimming pool. Hot tubs refer to large tubs of hot water in which the person bathing is submerged.</p>
<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>

<p>Their filtration systems are also made for hot tubs and are not designed to efficiently clean the amount of water found in a swim spa. Swim Spas provide the absolute best swimming exercise work out, using the least amount of space in your home or yard. By incorporating body jets into the sides of the tub, it became the bath that almost single-handedly created an industry. Another thing to remember if you are thinking of buying an indoor hot tub is that, although they are more convenient, indoor hot tubs require more complex installations than traditional outdoor ones.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level. As already mentioned, in addition to the standard equipment, hot tubs can be equipped with extra accessories like the devices for chromotherapy and aromatherapy. These are super-strong fibreglass pools with ceramic cores, manufactured to the very highest standards using the latest in swimming pool technology.</p>
<p>These very private cabana style mineral baths includes the world famous natural hot mineral water in a jetted hot tub, private naturally hot mineral water shower, private dressing room, Private fire ring, sundeck, towels, and robes. Swim spas can't also be used for summer parties, however, if you are a professional swimmer or an athlete, you should definitely go for it. Here, we have collected 10 more reasons why you might need a swim spa.</p>

If you have been thinking about getting a swimming pool, but don't have the funds to afford one, then you should look into a swim spa near you!. You can choose between models that create the swimming current with three jets or a dual prop propulsion system, which produces a really strong current.</p>
<p>A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
<p>If you want both hot and cold water in your spa then a dual zone swim spa is best. I use my hot tub almost every day, sometimes twice a day. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Innovative features include ergonomic seating, hydrotherapy jets, and strong filtration. Jacuzzi AccuPro jets are the building blocks for Jacuzzi's Whirlpool tub, and send out a precise, pinpointed flow of water and air to target specific trouble spots on the user's body.</p>
<p>Some swim spas may cost more upfront, but you get higher quality workmanship that costs you less to operate and maintain.

<p>Many swim spas come with a PH tester kit, but you can also purchase one separately. The Ergo Group deals with the finest quality outdoor and luxury products and is proud to partner with Jacuzzi® through Hydrolife. Likewise, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect luxury item that will help you increase the overall value of your home. The plumbing system of all Vortex swim spas is warranted against leaking for 5 years. If you've never learned how to swim you should take lessons at your local pool to learn the basics, but after that it is simply a matter of swimming length after length.</p>
<p>One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas. Most people see improvement in their symptoms when they simply stop going in hot tubs, but some people may need treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, according to a 2006 study from the Mayo Clinic. On Endless Pools' website, you can build your own swim spa and see a price quote right away, making it the only company we evaluated that posts all prices up front.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
