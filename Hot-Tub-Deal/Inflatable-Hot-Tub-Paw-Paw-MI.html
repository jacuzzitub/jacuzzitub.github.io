<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it.

<p>The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>Cedar Mountain Spa Covers prides itself on quality. Yep, you can try out one of our hot tubs for as long as you like. This hydrotherapeutic method will not harm the hot tub although it will take some time for the filters to effectively remove the vinegar from the water.
