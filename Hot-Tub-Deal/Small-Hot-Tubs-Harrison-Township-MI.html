<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>

<p>Coast Spas Hot Tubs and Swim Spas are optimized for superior Wellness. In this article, we're going to take a closer look at the many benefits of Hydropool Swim Spas. If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it. Realize that these style units may be a bit more costly because they need two completely separate filtering, pumping and heating systems.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
<p>The risks involved highlight the importance of using the correct chemical products for your pool and swim spa. Gone are the days where hot tubs are placed in one spot and stay there indefinitely. You should also remove and clean the Hot Tubs filter thoroughly making sure you remove any contamination. The majority of spa pools contain LED lighting or another kind built-in with various color options. Aquatic Circuit Training in a swimspa increases your aerobic and strength levels and burns more calories than other forms of exercise.</p>

<p>2. 24 hour circulation pumps-These pumps function by using a small pump to force water through the heating and filtration system. The ingenuity behind the Endless Pools Swim Machine is just the beginning of the many benefits of owning an Endless Pools Fitness Systems. This is not the case if the spa has a Spa Net” brand controller (fully heat pump compatible). Most people are not duly trained in installing whirlpool tubs so it is strongly advised to hire a contractor for installation.</p>
<p>After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body. Also the green view is one that is very much listened to by the hot tub industry resulting in much more ecological friendly Hot Tubs. By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>

Exercise pools allow you to exercise harder and work your body in a different ways than swimming laps in a regular sized pool. Spending time in a swim spa can even help improve your mental and emotional health. Just like in the case of hot tubs, keep well-hydrated and get out as soon as you experience any sign of discomfort.</p>
<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining. Another little-publicized benefit is that swim spa workouts can help people improve their balance, according to another 2018 article by Rick McAvoy.</p>

<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
