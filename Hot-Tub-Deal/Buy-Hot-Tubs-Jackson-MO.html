The Swim Spa is the perfect balance for those who want the best of both worlds, swimming and relaxing. The main parts of a hot tub pump are the wet end and the motor end.</p>
<p>After all, Endless Pools pioneered propeller-driven swim-in-place technology in 1988 and has remained the industry-leader for nearly 30 years.
