We also provide a selection of must-have hot tub accessories to complete your spa experience. Over the course of a year, they found six patients who were allergic to PPMS and who had also used this chemical to treat their hot tubs.

The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>
