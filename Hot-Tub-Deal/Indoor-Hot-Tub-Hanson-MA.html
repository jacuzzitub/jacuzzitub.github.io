If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it.

<p>Arctic Spas® is an original member in good standing as a certified HotTubStar manufacturer. In fact you will find it purifying drinking water and public swimming pools all around the world. Created to improve the quality of life for you and your family and built to last a lifetime. The ideal place for Jacuzzi tubs is in the garden or patio where you have substantial foundations to rely on. To enable all year round use you can construct a gazebo or small room around it. Windows can be used for ventilation, or to cool off on hot summer nights.</p>
<p>The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>According to promotional information we received from Hydropool, the company's self-cleaning spas like the AquaTrainer 14 fX can filter 100 percent of their water in 45 minutes. Your swim spa can be heated to the temperature of your choice. Jacuzzi may have been the first well known hot tub brand, but they may not offer the most affordable spas for sale on today's market. Shell - The part that contains the water and where you sit the body of the actual Hot Tub is referred to as the Shell.</p>
<p>One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>
