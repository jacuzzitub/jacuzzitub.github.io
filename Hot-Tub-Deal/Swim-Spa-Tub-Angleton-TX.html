This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>

That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>

<p>For the most part, swim spas costing between $10,000 and $20,000 are built with cost rather than quality in mind. Although it is small, at least compared to SwimEx's other spas, it's big enough to accommodate several people with enough room for all to exercise.
