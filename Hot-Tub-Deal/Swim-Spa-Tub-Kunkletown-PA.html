<p>When you own a hot tub or spa you certainly need to make sure you have some protection for it such as one of the quality spa covers that are available. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>Each of the Jacuzzi® hot tubs in the J-400 collection comes with a ProClarity filtration system and a CLEARRAY® purification system. Your Endless Pools Fitness System arrives pre-plumbed and ready to install on any sound, level surface: transform your patio, convert your garage into an aquatic escape, or dedicate new construction to your future wellbeing. Many a times, the delivery cost is included in the cost and some times it is not included in the cost of the hot tubs.</p>
