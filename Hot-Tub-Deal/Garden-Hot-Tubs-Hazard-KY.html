<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.

<h3>Hot Tub Pictures Hazard KY 41701</h3>
<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>You could, for instance, modify an existing hot tub you may have, adding extra jets to approximate the experience.

<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well.
