<p>Jetted bathtubs are gaining in popularity. This step completes the 4 layers found in the shell of a quality spa pool. The position of the jets also determines how the tubs can concentrate on certain parts of your body. The extra-wide, open shell design creates the ideal swim channel with virtually no reflective wave while stabilizing hip jets further ensure the perfect swim experience. All Endless Pools® Fitness Systems and SwimCross Exercise Systems feature a durable, two millimetre galvanised steel frame and ABS base pan which together provide superior support and protection from ground contact.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs ; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. These days, Jacuzzi employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide and has become the name we most associate with whirlpool baths.</p>
