<p>Jacuzzi® is the name that defines the hot tub experience. Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The massage is conducted by placing heated stones on the skin along the spine or on the chakras. Corner bathtubs also have a place in smaller homes and buildings. Spa systems (or air systems) are slightly different to a whirlpool bath in that they don't use water through the jets, but air. This is an Endless Pools Swimming Pool.
