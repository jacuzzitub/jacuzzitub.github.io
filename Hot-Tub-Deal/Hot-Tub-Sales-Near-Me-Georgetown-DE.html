The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>
