If the spa you are considering does not offer this it is likely a sign that they have not used quality products in the manufacturing of their jets.

At Master Spas, we make buying a swim spa just as relaxing as owning one.</p>
<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage.
