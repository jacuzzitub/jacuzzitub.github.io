<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length.

Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>
