Our product range includes Steam Bath Unit, Sauna Bath Unit, Shower Enclosure, Bath Tubs, Jacuzzi Systems, Spa Product, Bathroom Accessories and similar other products. The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants. You want to be in your tub, not taking a bunch of time to maintain it. That's why Rich's has carried Leisure Time, the premier name in hot tub water care for over twenty-five years.</p>
<p>When shopping for coverage, be sure that you mention the hot tub to make sure a provider will cover a property with a hot tub. For all swimming pools, insert removable skimmer baskets to catch large debris before entering into the filtration system. When this is done it takes forever for the tub to warm up due to very little amount of power flowing through the heating elements, I do not recommend this way of installation for the large units.</p>
