<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>Thanks to the MP line, you can enjoy full-body effects of aquatic exercise with time saving convenience in the privacy of your own home. A backlit buoyancy jet helps maintain ideal swimming position while stabilizing hip jets ensures the swimmer remains centered in the swim lane. Although, hot tubs and spas are convenient to use, they have a shortcoming associated with them also. If your hot tub pump seal is leaking, you will need to find the correct seal kit.</p>

<h3>Hot Tubs, Spas, Chemicals, Accessories & Service Culpeper</h3>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance.

They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.

<p>Introducing the all-new Endless Pools® Fitness Systems. The Synergy Series feature two high-powered Elite Pro jets for a variety of family fun and fitness opportunities. On this website, you will get lots of information related to the best types of hot tubs. If the spa you are considering does not offer this it is likely a sign that they have not used quality products in the manufacturing of their jets. But if you are willing to put up with cheaper construction, a less powerful motor, and higher lifetime heating costs, the difference in purchase price between the two hot tubs might make buying the less expensive one a perfectly reasonable decision.</p>
<p>The IX Jet merges maximum airflow with high-output LED lighting, sending multicolored champagne-like bubbles from the bottom of the hot tub to the surface.

<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end.
