The internet can be a perfect place to purchase a cheap hot tub instead of from a hot tub dealer's showroom, but be careful with internet hot tub retailers as they might not be genuine, they could be selling poor quality hot tubs or not be around in the future to support you with warranty problems or spare parts like filters. Not only the initial cost is lower than swim pools, but the use of water, the required heating, and the chemicals are less due to the size difference.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
