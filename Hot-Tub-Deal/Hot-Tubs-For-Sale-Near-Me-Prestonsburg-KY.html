After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot. Every aspect of Jacuzzi® hot tubs is designed for energy efficiency, from the proprietary shell construction to the jet pumps and the insulating cover, Jacuzzi save customers money in operating costs year on year.</p>

Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>

The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets.
