<p>Hot Tubs Rock is a local and independently owned company based in Magor, South Wales. I have quickly become addicted to a rigorous program of aquatic exercise and swimming. If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them. Swim spas can come with either one or two tanks. After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot. Every aspect of Jacuzzi® hot tubs is designed for energy efficiency, from the proprietary shell construction to the jet pumps and the insulating cover, Jacuzzi save customers money in operating costs year on year.</p>
<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>

<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision.

Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
