<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>Swim Pro Swim & Fitness Spas are precision-engineered to offer resistance swimming against a smooth current that is adjustable to your speed and ability. You will discover that the customer reviews on these products are biased but in a good way in that your choice in a hot tub for the home will be made easier. Some hot tubs require lengthy installations, however we've managed to pick out a range of hot tubs that don't require that much fuss, so you can simply plug and play, turning your garden into a luxury spa in an instant.</p>
