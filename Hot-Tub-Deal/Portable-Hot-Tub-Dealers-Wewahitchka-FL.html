<p>Their filtration systems are also made for hot tubs and are not designed to efficiently clean the amount of water found in a swim spa. Swim Spas provide the absolute best swimming exercise work out, using the least amount of space in your home or yard. By incorporating body jets into the sides of the tub, it became the bath that almost single-handedly created an industry. Another thing to remember if you are thinking of buying an indoor hot tub is that, although they are more convenient, indoor hot tubs require more complex installations than traditional outdoor ones.</p>
<p>We want to be seen as the brand spearheading innovations in swimspa technology, like our hydraulically balanced plumbing which ensures the correct water pressure to the hydrotherapy jets or the WaveRider Control.

They can also look more attractive than swim spas, thanks to the extensive range of exterior cladding and pool colour choices they offer.</p>
<p>These help to make your workout more intensive by offering more resistance in the water, so you are basically swimming the equivalent of a long distance within a relatively small space.
