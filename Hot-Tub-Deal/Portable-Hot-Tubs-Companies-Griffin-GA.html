<p>At the end of a long day, few things are better than soaking in a bubbly hot tub. If you really love your swim spa or hot tub and want to use it while you are pregnant, you can set the temperature lower, stay in less than 10 minutes, take your temperature, and pay close attention to any feelings of discomfort or sweating. This hot tub has a whopping 120 jets which users say recreates a proper Jacuzzi-style spa in their home.

The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
