<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive. ThermoSpas' parent company, Jacuzzi Brands LLC (Jacuzzi”), is a global company and we may transfer your personal data to ThermoSpas affiliates within the Jacuzzi family of companies or to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>We want to be seen as the brand spearheading innovations in swimspa technology, like our hydraulically balanced plumbing which ensures the correct water pressure to the hydrotherapy jets or the WaveRider Control. Lucky for you, a swim spa can offer a more controlled environment to help your kids learn the basics of swimming. They can also look more attractive than swim spas, thanks to the extensive range of exterior cladding and pool colour choices they offer.</p>

<p>The major ways are sexual intercourse, wiping from back to front after urinating, and sometimes from soaking in warm water. Vortex Spas are plumbed using Duraflex flexible PVC plumbing, which is specially designed for use in high performance swim spas.
