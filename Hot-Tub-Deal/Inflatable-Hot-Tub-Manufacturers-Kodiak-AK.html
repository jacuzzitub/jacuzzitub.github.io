The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in.

They are slightly larger than traditional bathtubs and have features similar to fiberglass whirlpools. Besides those benefits, swimming spas can also help your heart and lungs.
