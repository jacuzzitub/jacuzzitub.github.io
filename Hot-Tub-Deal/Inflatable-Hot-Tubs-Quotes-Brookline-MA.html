SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>
<p>Affordable to buy and to operate, J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are available in several different sizes and configurations. Before you buy a hot tub for your backyard or step into those warm waters at the spa or gym, make sure you know a bit about their safety. Many of our showrooms have a swim spas on the floor that you can sit in to get an idea of the size but if you let us know in advance we can fill one up with water to try out the jets as well.</p>

<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location. Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
