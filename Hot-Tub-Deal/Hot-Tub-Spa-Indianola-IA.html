If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>

While technically Jacuzzi is a proper and brand name, when people use the word jacuzzi, they are referring to a standard hot tub.</p>
