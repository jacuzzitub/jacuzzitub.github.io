<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>

As the name itself suggest, you could take portable hot tubs with you when you decide to relocate.</p>
<p>You want to stay hydrated while soaking and drinking a cool glass” of water, fruit juice or tea is such a pleasant way to go. But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking. Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>
<p>Popular pump brands include Waterway pumps, Ultra Jet, Vico, Master Series and Hayward. However, Vortex have pioneered it's use in spa pools. There are some disadvantages of swim spas that you should be aware of before deciding on getting one. Made from high-quality materials, these tubs are also chemically inert and nonporous. This is especially so for internet based spas that are sold on price and know that by the time you try it out it is too late to change your mind.</p>

They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool.
