Environmental reasons for spa & hot tub odors are due to the build-up of bio-films on spa surfaces and plumbing lines that contribute to the formation of White Water Mold and Pink Slime and all of their odors. Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub owners in the GTA, Kitchener, Barrie and London are provided with a world-class hot tub ownership experience - for life. Jacuzzi pumps and filters for swimming pools are now made by a Canadian company.</p>

Blood pressure is balanced, people with diabetes has their blood sugar levels reduced, people can sleep better, headaches and minor body pains are taken away, and much more can happen with a regular soak in a tub.</p>
