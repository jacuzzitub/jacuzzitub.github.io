<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. For those who really need exercise and can't just go for a run, a swim spa may be the answer. Spa Tacular Hot Tubs first opened its doors for business in 1999.

Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>

Sedona Spas fabricates all of our own spa shells in house, this allows us to ensure the utmost quality in production as well as offer our own brand of unique design.
