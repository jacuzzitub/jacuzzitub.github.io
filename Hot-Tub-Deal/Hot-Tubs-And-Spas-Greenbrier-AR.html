<p>A swim spa is ideal for swimming but did you know that it is an ultimate training machine? A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>

<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>
<p>Depending on how you use the Hot Tub and the people that actually use it you should fully drain and inspect your hot tub say every three to six months. The paddlewheel current allows people to swim side by side, and there's also an area of still water for people who prefer that.
