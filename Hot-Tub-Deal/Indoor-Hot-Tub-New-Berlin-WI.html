Not only does a Vortex Swim Spa have less water to heat, but when combined with our Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump it's the most cost effective heated swimming pool option.

<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water. For example, the first time you use your new tub and try to remove its bulky 7'x7' cover, you will quickly understand the value of a hydraulic cover lifter: a device that makes it a breeze to open and close your cover. There are hot tubs made for only one, and they go up in size from there. The word spa refers to a tub filled with water that has heat for the water and jets to spray the water and circulate it throughout the tub.</p>

Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one.

<p>There are portable hot tubs available in the market nowadays. Adding a few cups of apple cider vinegar to a hot tub will aid in relieving sore muscles. The brand is known for their innovation, holding more than 250 patents for their state-of-the-art hydrotherapy features ranging from water purification to jet capabilities. Emerging yourself into the warm waters of a Hot Tub or Spa can actually help your health. It doesn't hurt to sit in a bathtub of hot water because your upper body generally is not fully submerged and the materials used to build tubs cool the water quickly, unlike swim spa materials and systems.</p>
<p>It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area. Unlike pools, you can change the current intensity to suit any swimming level you desire. Hot tub accidents or injuries for home residents are not covered; that falls under your health insurance plan.</p>
<p>In addition, Jacuzzi is also supplied with Filtration system to keep water fresh and sparkling. Along with the great customer satisfaction that we have always strived to provide, now we also offer FREE water testing and filter cleaning by donation - along with FREE site checks for those interested in a new Arctic Spa or swimming pool. I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
