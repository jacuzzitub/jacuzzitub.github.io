<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what a hot tub is, the simplest definition comes from ancient times when the tubs were made of wood and their purpose was water treatment. Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced. The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
