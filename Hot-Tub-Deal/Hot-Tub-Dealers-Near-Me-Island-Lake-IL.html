I would recommend Spa World (especially their swim spa range) to anyone that is weighing between a spa and a pool.

Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
<p>So hot tubs are really nothing new but they have evolved tremendous amounts. Our swim pools offer our attractive styles that are visually appealing for any backyard environment.
