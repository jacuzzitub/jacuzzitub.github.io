However, some policies exclude coverage for free-standing hot tubs. Science aside, the most important benefit of time in a hot tub is the state of relaxation that's a part of every soak. Most hot tub and swim spa dealers have now realized the power of the Internet and have quickly set up their websites and have uploaded the photos of their products.</p>
