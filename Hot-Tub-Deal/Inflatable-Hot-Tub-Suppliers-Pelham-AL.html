<p>The Balboa Water Group is widely known for its lines of equipment, accessories and control system for the leisure water industry. In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight. From our design engineers in California to our tradespeople in Georgia, we take pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>

<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in. Units with such heaters cost more and do use more electricity. Jacuzzi tubs come in a variety of sizes and shapes such as round, square, oval, kidney shaped.</p>

Size - With most swimming pools starting at a size of 18x36', they can take up a significant amount of our space. Fiberglass whirlpools have high pressure 'jets' that create a whirlpool effect.

Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
