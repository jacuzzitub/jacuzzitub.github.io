<p>If you like meeting new people and being in business for yourself, than this is a business that I think would be a really fun business to set up, and do. Especially going to people's houses, and working and setting up soft tubs & hot tubs for them. The J-500 Collection Combining innovative technology, ground-breaking design and legendary Jacuzzi® hydromassage, The J-500® Collection establishes a new standard in backyard luxury. Your time with us in the Canberra show room was not only educational to operating a spa, but also the benefits in purchasing a Spa World spa.

It uses a paddlewheel to create full-spa water currents, while its flat, non-skid floor permits all kinds of exercise, including those that require aquatic exercise equipment.

For a more challenging workout turn on the swim current and you will experience increased resistance against core, leg and upper body muscle groups. The whole essence of the spa is one of pampering and relaxation and most of the larger spas will have a suite of treatment rooms where you can have massages, facials and a wide range of body treatments.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of luxury you're going for you can get hot tubs with different jet speeds, mood lighting and even built in sound systems so you can really make the most of your outdoor space. This acrylic bathtub is extensively used at homes, hotels and many other places. On average, a Jacuzzi tub weighs 700 Lbs, and once you add water and your body weight into the equation, the entire setup can weigh up to 1,000 Lbs.</p>

<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure. If you don't have kids or plan to only use your spa for swimming and exercise, a one tank spa might work out better.

The benefits of hydrotherapy, whether in a swimming pool, or in a spa, are wide-spread.</p>
<p>If the hot tub freezes or is damaged due to maintenance issues, count on any claim you put in being denied regardless of how your specific policy handles hot tubs. The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo. To prevent this, take specified breaks from the exercise to drink water, and ensure that at least a half gallon of water is being consumed each day - to prevent these swimming dehydration risks.</p>
<p>A system of heaters and jets keep it bubbling, which create satisfying massaging sensation and eventually work as an excellent anecdote to anxiety and stress. Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>
