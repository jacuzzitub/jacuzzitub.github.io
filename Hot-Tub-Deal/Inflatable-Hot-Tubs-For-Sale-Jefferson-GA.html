<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go.

Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
