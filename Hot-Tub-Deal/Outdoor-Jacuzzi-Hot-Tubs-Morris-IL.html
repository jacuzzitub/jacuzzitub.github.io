As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together. Sensing the American consumers interest in health, fitness and leisure activities, Roy invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath in 1968.</p>
<p>Exercise in general will increase the amount of air taken into the lungs, but swimming in particular can make a big impact.
