<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.

<p>Vortex Spas are the best value, high quality spas available anywhere in the world. According to an article in Skiing Magazine, When you immerse yourself in the hot water of a hot tub, the temperature of your skin and muscles rise, causing blood vessels to dilate and thus increasing blood flow to the skin and muscles.

<h3>Are Hot Tubs A Cause Of Urinary Tract Infections Export</h3>
<p>And while a number of studies have touted the benefits of swimming over every other form of exercise (including jogging and walking!), and include swimming as a recommended form of exercise for everything from increasing the chances of conception in women to easing the suffering of those with Fibromyalgia, very few insurance plans offer any sort of coverage or assistance when making the purchase of a swimming spa.</p>
