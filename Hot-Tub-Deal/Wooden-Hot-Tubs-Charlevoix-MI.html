<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>The IX Jet merges maximum airflow with high-output LED lighting, sending multicolored champagne-like bubbles from the bottom of the hot tub to the surface. Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs Ontario has made your dream a reality with the Jacuzzi for Life program Jacuzzi for Life is an exclusive customer program and is the only one of its kind in the entire industry. At that time you could get a pretty nice portable hot tub for about $4000 and a fairly well equipped inground pool for around $25,000.</p>

<p>Browse through the catalogs to find premium quality corner bathtubs, couple bathtubs, oval bathtubs, round series bathtubs, jacuzzis bathtubs, etc. Pay a little more and you'll get a better swimming experience, better components and lower running costs. You would usually work your entire backyard around a dedicated swimming pool area, but a swim spa will fit into a much smaller backyard or outdoor alfresco area.</p>
<p>Ask any family with a Vortex Swim Spa and they will tell you the kids absolutely LOVE THEM. From the jetted seats to do a massage for your muscles, the dual zone with hot and cold water, and the temperature control panels to offer a great healing experience for tore muscles, pains, and cramps. By producing a continuous current, swim spa water pressure encourages continuous swimming motion, producing a more effective exercise regimen.</p>
<p>Even though the swimming space is smaller than in a regular pool, it is still larger than most swim spas, and you have the option of including swim jets if you want a more intensive swimming experience. Furthermore, customers can avail this acrylic bathtub from us at market prices. All Vortex swim spa frames use top quality, durable steel. Complete Jacuzzi or whirlpool kits with strategically placed Hydro-jet Nozzles.</p>

<p>The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<p>Experience Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas. If you are going to heat your spa - as the larger the spa the more water you have to heat. Customers that visit our store after having purchased from one of these Super Duper Spa Shows” are flabbergasted to find that they could have purchased a better quality, name brand spa from Amazon Hot Tubs for less than they paid at the show; quality brands like Jacuzzi®, Hot Spring®, and American Whirlpool®, just to name a few.</p>
