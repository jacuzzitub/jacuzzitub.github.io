<p>You don't have to be a swimmer to get the benefits of an exercise pool. On the other end, a pair of powerful swim jets produce one of the smoothest swim currents in the industry, fully adjustable for any level swimmer, with a backlit buoyancy jet that illuminates the swim current and combines the perfect amount of air to elevate the swimmer into the ideal position. Our collection of swim and fitness spas are the pinnacle of performance and style providing improved wellness and a better quality of life conveniently at home.</p>

<p>This can range from large, spa pools which you might find in a leisure centre or health club, to private whirlpool baths for domestic properties. Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Many swim spas come with a PH tester kit, but you can also purchase one separately. The Ergo Group deals with the finest quality outdoor and luxury products and is proud to partner with Jacuzzi® through Hydrolife. Likewise, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect luxury item that will help you increase the overall value of your home. The plumbing system of all Vortex swim spas is warranted against leaking for 5 years. If you've never learned how to swim you should take lessons at your local pool to learn the basics, but after that it is simply a matter of swimming length after length.</p>

At Amazon Hot Tubs, our spa technicians take the time to teach you how to maintain safe, crystal clear water using one of our low-chlorine or non-chlorine sanitation systems, and we are always ready to answer any questions you may have about keeping your water in great shape.

Keep in mind your intended use before you spend the money on a spa or hot tub. This is great news for Orange County swimmers and fitness enthusiasts who are seeking to get their swim on, in a strong current. To prevent hot tub rash, the CDC recommends showering with soap and cleaning your swimsuit after getting out of the water.</p>
<p>Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets.

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>Because they use a heavy gauge vinyl liner inside the steel wall panels (just like a standard steel wall inground swimming pool), you are not constrained by a mold. PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization. There are dangers to buying used spas, and if the hot tub is not set up and running so you can test the pump, heater, and other features, then you might be very disappointed when you get it home and set up.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
