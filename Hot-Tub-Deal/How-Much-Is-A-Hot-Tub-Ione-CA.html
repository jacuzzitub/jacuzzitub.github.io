<p>Whether you are anxious about swimming classes for you or you are afraid for the safety of your children, swim spas offer an opportunity for private swimming classes.

Aquatic exercise in an exercise pool gives all the benefits of land-based aerobic workouts, but keeps your body cool and comfortable and no impact injury potential. The International Swimming Federation or the Federation Internationale de la Natation (FINA) sets the standards for competition pools.</p>
<p>Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
