<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard.
