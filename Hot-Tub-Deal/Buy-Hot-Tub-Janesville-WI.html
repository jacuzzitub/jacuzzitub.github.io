<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in. However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>

<p>The two-in-one design of these fitness and exercise pools gives you the best of both worlds through gentle resistance for laps and after you're finished-hydromassaging jets to soothe your muscles. Audio and visual options are offered in the majority of spa pool and swim spa deals today. The filtration system in your spa pool is vital for providing you with pristine water. The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>
<p>In North America it is law for any commercial establishment to have a closed pressurized filtration system on any public pool or hot tub. All Vortex spas feature perimeter insulation that's designed to minimise heat loss. Whether you call it a Spa or a Hot Tub, we have the perfect one for your needs. Whether you're interested in a form of socializing or a powerful way to rejuvenate and refresh your mind and body, Jacuzzi® hot tubs will leave you fully satisfied.</p>
<p>With regular workouts lasting a reasonable amount of time (no, five minutes is not going to cut it), the body's compensation for the lack of lung capacity underwater will in turn increase capacity on dry land. While typically installed on a patio, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can be installed indoors in a converted garage or with new construction. Onsens: using a hot spring as the source of hot water an Onsen is a public or private communal bathing house.</p>
<h3>Hot Tubs, Spas, Chemicals, Accessories & Service Janesville</h3>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>

Even at full power, it feels like swimming in a the smooth current of open water. At Amazon Hot Tubs, our customers become our friends.

Portable hot tubs provide the same experience and fun as a standard hot tub. Hot tubs with an ozonator will help sanitize your hot tub, while hot tubs that have a stereo will let you enjoy some relaxing music.</p>
