<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that every body enjoys so much. Bacteria like a warm moist environment to grow in. You need to make sure they don't get it. If you wear a swimsuit in the hot tub, take it off immediately when you get out.

If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa.
