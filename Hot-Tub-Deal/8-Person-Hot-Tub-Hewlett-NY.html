<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>Whether you want a hot tub for two to three people, six to seven, or somewhere in between, you'll find the perfect balance between size, seating, and cost in a J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tub. Paradise Swimming Pools at the Northbrook & Frankfort locations feature a hot tub attached to the pool.
