<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>A soak in the hot tub is also helpful for stimulating healthy blood flow and stress relief. Sitting in a hot tub spa with the water temperature no higher than 104 degrees helps relax your body. Most cases are tied to indoor hot tubs, where there is less ventilation. An advantage of swim spas over a traditional swimming pool is its ability to be used year round.
