<p>Perhaps one may want to enjoy and own your very own Hot Tub but you are just not able to justify the cost of a brand new one. Only the Swim Spa WaterWatch® tracks distance and monitors performance, heart rate, calories and more while offering real time results and feedback.

From time to time it may become necessary to update or change our Privacy Statement and ThermoSpas encourages you to periodically check here for the most current version.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>

Next, it is important that you check the pH balance of the water in your jacuzzi style hot tub on a regular basis.
