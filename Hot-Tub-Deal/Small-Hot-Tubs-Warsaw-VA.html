<p>Hot tubs come in various sizes ranging from the cute, two person "Soft Tub" to the very large multiple person party units. Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Swimming spas are typically smaller compared to the size of a regular swimming pool. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. You can step into a Jacuzzi hot tub knowing you will enjoy the benefits of hydrotherapy for years to come. However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
