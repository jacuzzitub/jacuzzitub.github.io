<p>Change body positions to target different muscle groups for horizontal swimming, upright aerobic fitness and seated strength conditioning.

Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>
