<p>Hot tubs come in various sizes ranging from the cute, two person "Soft Tub" to the very large multiple person party units. Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Of course, there also are "public" hot tubs, which are often found at places like gyms or spa resorts. This range features includes: Standard Control Panel, Classic Jets, Classic Foot Massage, 2-Stage Filtration, Multi Coloured Lighting, Comfortable Headrests, Built-in Drink Holders and Classic Waterfall.
