<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs.

However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people.

Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
