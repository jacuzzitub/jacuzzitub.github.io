<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property.

<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining.
