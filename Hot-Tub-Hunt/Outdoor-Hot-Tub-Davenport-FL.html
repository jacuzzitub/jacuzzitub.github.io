<p>If you live in an area with a seasonal swim season, spring is the time to prepare for your pool opening. Some models even have a swim spa and hot tub combo, so you can massage those tired and aching muscles after a morning workout. Most complaints were about walk-in tubs in general rather than Jacuzzi itself. We're concerned with your experience for the life of your Fitness or Exercise System ownership. Here are some easy ways that you can find a leak in your hot tub.
