Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls.

They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
