<p>After reviewing several portable hot tubs, we decided the Lay-Z Spa Miami was the one we would purchase. If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa. Whether you decided on the built-in model or installing a swim spa in your garden, the cost of installation is much less than constructing an in-ground swimming pool that requires a lot of labor work to get done.</p>
<p>Full range-of-motion swim strokes, stationary leg kicks, banded resistance and rowing, low-impact step training, stretching and heated-water aerobics are all possible with ATV. Swim spas come in all shapes and sizes. The entire team at Mile High Hot Tubs has been great to work with. Sitting in a body of water that is warmer than your body's temperature will raise your temperature, whether it's a bath, hot springs, or hot tub.</p>
