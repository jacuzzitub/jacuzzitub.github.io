<p>With the combination of heat and humidity, and water - your body is more than likely losing water while swimming.

We have all been there, training in a pool too hot or cold is not an enjoyable experience. If you keep your swim spa clean, you won't end up in germ-filled water and it will last longer, maximizing your financial and health investment.</p>
<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it. Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
