Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub.

Today, Jacuzzi features an expanded luxury tub environment, with four types of therapeutic tubs. Our hot tubs are extremely durable, but should anything go wrong, you won't be left high and dry.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at horsepower, though, make sure you consider the swim spas GPM, or gallons per minute rating. The HL 8DL is a great hot tub to relax in, the Healthy Living 8 Dual Lounge provides reclined seating for two at once, 44 hydrotherapy jets, and LED lighting. But hot tubs are not all the same as one another and the qualifications of their makers differ as well. Most mid-range swim spas are also built with more equipment that is designed for swim spas.</p>

<p>Because they use a heavy gauge vinyl liner inside the steel wall panels (just like a standard steel wall inground swimming pool), you are not constrained by a mold. PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization. There are dangers to buying used spas, and if the hot tub is not set up and running so you can test the pump, heater, and other features, then you might be very disappointed when you get it home and set up.</p>

<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out.
