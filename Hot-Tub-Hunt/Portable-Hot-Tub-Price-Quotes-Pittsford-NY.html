<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Environmental reasons for spa & hot tub odors are due to the build-up of bio-films on spa surfaces and plumbing lines that contribute to the formation of White Water Mold and Pink Slime and all of their odors. Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub owners in the GTA, Kitchener, Barrie and London are provided with a world-class hot tub ownership experience - for life. Jacuzzi pumps and filters for swimming pools are now made by a Canadian company.</p>

<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety. The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>
<p>Whether you are anxious about swimming classes for you or you are afraid for the safety of your children, swim spas offer an opportunity for private swimming classes. This is a feature that allows a Jacuzzi to keep the water in the tub warm. This is not limited to just swimming, but also includes underwater aerobics, aquatic therapy, weight lifting and other water-based exercise routines. PDC's Top Quality Acrylic Spas are set apart from other hot tubs with a full range of exclusive patented features including PDC's Temperlock energy conservation system, Air'sagge warm air therapy, Powerflo filtration, and AdvantagePack equipment flexibility.</p>
<p>The air jets on a Spa system will be on the bottom of your bath. Hot tubs are available with both cottages holidays, and lodge holidays. Forget about the anxiety of public pools, the drive to fancy spas to pamper yourself, or searching for physical therapy centers. Sometimes all the water jets may automatically move or rotate, again providing the effect of a massage. Warm water is known to soothe muscles. A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>

Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
