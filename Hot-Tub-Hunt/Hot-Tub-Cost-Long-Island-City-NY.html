<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>As a different alternative to an above ground swim spa, you could consider a Little Pool These are smaller versions of full-sized fibreglass swimming pools, made to the same high standards, but they are portable, easy to install, and instant to use. Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>The latest hot tubs have superior ozone systems resulting in the use of much less chemicals. This open-concept tank is large enough to offer many of the benefits that swimming pools do. Often, companies that offer swimming pool cleaning services recommend lowering the water level for winterizing. Key questions to answer when shopping for a hot tub are how many people will be using it at one time, and where you plan to place your hot tub.</p>
<p>Muscle pain and stiffness cannot remain in your body when the hot, high speed water surrounds you. Most of the hot tubs on Wayfair require a water and electrical source, but if neither are viable in the area where you plan to place your hot tub, a popup hot tub might make more sense. After a swimming work-out you can relax in the spa zone and choose from a lounger seat, a neck and shoulder massage seat, 2 back massage seats or the frequently used cool down seat.</p>
