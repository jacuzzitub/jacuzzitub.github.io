<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>You are going to want to invest a bit of energy in putting it away where it is free from accumulation of dust and particles so that you experience a more comfortable spa session each time you use it. The number of motors and pumps is in direct relation to the actual size of the Hot Tub the number of jets and the degree of therapy delivered. Hydrotherapy is a therapeutic whole-body treatment that involves moving and exercising in water; essentially physiotherapy in a pool.</p>

<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>
<p>When hot water runs out, wait a half hour for the water heater to recover and do it again. Making sure hot tubs have the right levels of disinfectants is essential to preventing Legionella infection, the agency says.

<p>The range of sizes is the smallest of the websites we evaluated with spas as small as 1,347 and only as large as 1,453, but this range does seem to be the most common sizes of swim spas on the market.

Bio-film removing products further prevent bio-film build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills.

An advantage of having a small hot tub is that it makes it a lot easier to get it into gardens as many small tubs are designed to be fit through a standard door therefore there is no expense for a crane to get the tub into the garden and it makes it easier to carry the tub into your garden.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
