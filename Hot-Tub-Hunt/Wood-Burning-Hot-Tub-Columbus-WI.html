With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>

<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current.
