<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms. Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing. You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>

<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it. Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
