<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive.

Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
