<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.

<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help. This is why most people have their swim spa above ground and consider building steps or a deck around it if they want a more landscaped look. In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa. Lidos, ocean pools, in Australia were created by enclosing a section of the rock shelf where water circulates through the pools or by constant flooding over the side of the pool during high tide.</p>
<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted. The TruSwim® unique dual propulsion design guarantees an incomparable aquatic fitness experience with endless possibilities. We have been researching, ranking and reviewing swim spas for more than four years.</p>
<p>With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home.

The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born.

The real swimming machine with patent pending technology for the widest, smoothest most even swim and fitness current.

<p>If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance. You may not think of a spa as life-changing, but Clarity Spas aren't just any hot tub. Thus, you can consider swimming at the beach instead of swimming in a swimming pool. 6. Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets. The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>

<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too.

<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation. The Hydrozone Pro has two powerful swim jets and three pumps, while the Pro Plus has three swim jets and four pumps and the Hydrozone Extreme is the ultimate with four powerful swim jets and five pumps. Three primary actions are important for maintaining the water in your Hot Tub in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>Some cheap Hot Tubs which are usually cheap imports from the East claim to have many Jets but many times there are just simple pin point Jets, which do not rotate, or cross fire and are un-adjustable and in my view not really worth having but can look very enticing to a prospective purchaser. The best advice is that you should see any used hot tub jacuzzi in full working action before you agree to buy it. If, when you go to see it and it is empty of water or is disconnected from the electricity then you should obviously arrange for another visit or wait for it to be reconnected and filled up with water, and turned on.</p>
