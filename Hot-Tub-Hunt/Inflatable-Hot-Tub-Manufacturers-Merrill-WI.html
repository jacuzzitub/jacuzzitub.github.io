<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Whether you want a hot tub for two to three people, six to seven, or somewhere in between, you'll find the perfect balance between size, seating, and cost in a J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tub. Paradise Swimming Pools at the Northbrook & Frankfort locations feature a hot tub attached to the pool. People who use a swim spa to get fit and stay fit using aquatic exercise find that they actually make greater progress faster using an exercise pool than on ground.</p>

Now it is time to enjoy your work, you did good, celebrate in your new hot tub. Hot tubs are usually made of wood, but they can also be made from synthetic wood materials.

<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>

It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>It has the performance and style synonymous with Jacuzzi®, and is the ideal introduction to the many benefits of hydrotherapy that its classic jets can deliver. You still get jet options to concentrate water sprays to various parts of the body for a soothing water massage. Jacuzzi pump parts and most any type of seals are available online, but be sure to get the right kit for your particular pump type and brand.</p>
<p>They gave me a great price on the hot tub and the entire experience was great. Besides hydromassage, there are hot tubs with chromotherapy that, thanks to underwater lights, emit rays of colored lights able to infuse energy and balance while ameliorating the mood. From jet placement to optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a JACUZZI® Hot Tub is a showcase in quality design. They soon created a tub with a built-in jet whirlpool, which took off in popularity.</p>

The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo.

<p>Imagine the luxury of being able to swim laps from your very own swimming pool at home.
