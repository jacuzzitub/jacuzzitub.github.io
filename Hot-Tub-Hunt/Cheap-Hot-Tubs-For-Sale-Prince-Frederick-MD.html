<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
