<p>A swim spa is ideal for swimming but did you know that it is an ultimate training machine? A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
<p>If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area. While there are many similarities between an exercise spa, lap pool and swim spa, securing a great deal comes from understanding exactly what you are looking for and why. We provide this Jacuzzi bathtub on several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers.</p>

<h3>Hot Tub Health Benefits Portsmouth</h3>
<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it.
