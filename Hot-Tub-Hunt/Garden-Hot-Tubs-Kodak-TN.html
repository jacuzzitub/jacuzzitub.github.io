Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>
<p>Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year. Soaking in your hot tub can be a true panacea for your health. Swim spas have this feature wherein you can swim in place for as long as you want.</p>
