By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>One penis rash (which can also be found elsewhere on the body) that can develop in a hot tub that is not properly clean is called hot tub rash (aka pseudomonas folliculitis). After a busy week, the family wants a small entertainment together and getting into the swim spa is one of the best ways to do so. The H2X is also a great fun center for all the family members. Certain chemicals, such as chlorine and bromine, can kill germs in swim spas, pools and hot tubs as long as proper pH and disinfectant levels are maintained.</p>
