In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure.

By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
