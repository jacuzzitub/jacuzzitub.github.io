<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. Given its background, the options that Jacuzzi offers elevates bathing from a cleaning session to a bathing experience you'd find in a spa. Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean.

Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
