<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi. Designed for ease of use, durability and carefree maintenance, hot tubs deliver a lifetime of pleasure, wherever you are. Each seat is tactically fitted with various types of massage jets in different positions, mounted in a way to massage every part of the body.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>

Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
