The pricing on Jacuzzi bathtubs changes rapidly depending on the features the tubs offer. I heard the other day that somebody who had bought a cheap Hot Tub which was an eastern import is unable to get the spare parts so that the heater does not work.</p>
<p>Hot tubs: there are several different types of hot tubs available for purchase on Wayfair. At Master Spas , we worked for nearly 30 years to perfect your spa experience. Determined to improve the lives of our customers with the promise of leading edge technology and offering a different approach to owning a SwimLife Swimspa. For those with children or larger social networks, a bigger sized swim spa will allow everyone to use the tub simultaneously while feeling comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
