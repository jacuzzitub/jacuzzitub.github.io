<p>Those of us who regularly use a Hot Tub Jacuzzi know the very many benefits that one receives and if you have not tried one then you must take the time out to submerge your self in the natural warm water therapy to find out what you are missing. Adding a Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump to your spa will give you the lowest possible heating costs. Ideal for full-body relief, the J-475 JACUZZI® Hot Tub's 5-6 seat configuration offers the ultimate in style with a relaxing, extra-wide illuminated waterfall, plus an at-a-glance indicator light, color touch screen control panel, and stunning Pro-Finish cabinetry accented by corner lighting.

<p>The maintenance of the spa is of great concern to all the owners of swim spas. Known for innovation, Jacuzzi is the company that started the modern hot tub industry. Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub.

With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool.

Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
