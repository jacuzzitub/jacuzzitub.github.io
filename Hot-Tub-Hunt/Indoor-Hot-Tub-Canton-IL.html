<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>

Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub owners in the GTA, Kitchener, Barrie and London are provided with a world-class hot tub ownership experience - for life. Jacuzzi pumps and filters for swimming pools are now made by a Canadian company.</p>
<p>Swimming spas are typically smaller compared to the size of a regular swimming pool. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. You can step into a Jacuzzi hot tub knowing you will enjoy the benefits of hydrotherapy for years to come. However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>
<p>For decades, the name Jacuzzi” has been synonymous with any contained body of water which includes water jets to aid relaxation. A Swim Spa is essentially an over-sized spa with an added current.

<p>A night in my hot tub before bed and sometimes I the morning before work. The internet can be a perfect place to purchase a cheap hot tub instead of from a hot tub dealer's showroom, but be careful with internet hot tub retailers as they might not be genuine, they could be selling poor quality hot tubs or not be around in the future to support you with warranty problems or spare parts like filters. Not only the initial cost is lower than swim pools, but the use of water, the required heating, and the chemicals are less due to the size difference.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
