<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats.

Even if you went for the most expensive swim spa that has all the accessories and all the features you desire, purchasing and installing it will still cost you much less than choosing a swimming pool and trying to install it.</p>
<p>We consider the styles and sizes of swim spas each company makes as well as the number of spas available, the kinds of water jet propulsion systems used and price range.

Another important task is testing and adjusting the alkalinity of the water because if your water is hard, you'll end up having to replace swim spa parts.</p>
