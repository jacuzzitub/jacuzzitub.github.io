<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>

After a busy week, the family wants a small entertainment together and getting into the swim spa is one of the best ways to do so. The H2X is also a great fun center for all the family members. Certain chemicals, such as chlorine and bromine, can kill germs in swim spas, pools and hot tubs as long as proper pH and disinfectant levels are maintained.</p>
<p>Of course, every Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a spa. Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers. Swimming pools make a great sand-less alternative, but laps in a public pool aren't always possible, and, of course, not private, and installing and maintaining your own pool may be too costly, not to mention the fact that you can't take it with you if you move or you may simply not have the space to accommodate one.</p>
<p>Even though you are using one of the many spa covers available on the market they will not keep your hot tub or spa free from all bacteria.
