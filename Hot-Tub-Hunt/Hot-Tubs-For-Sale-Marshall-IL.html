<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa. Have a look at our massive range of spa pools and contact us or your local spa shop to sit in some to see how they fit.</p>
