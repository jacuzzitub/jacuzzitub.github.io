<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive.

People who have opted for an exercise pool rather than a standard swimming pool find it is much better for exercise plus the running costs are a fraction of those of a large pool.</p>
