<p>Introducing the all-new Endless Pools® Fitness Systems. The Synergy Series feature two high-powered Elite Pro jets for a variety of family fun and fitness opportunities. On this website, you will get lots of information related to the best types of hot tubs.

But if you are willing to put up with cheaper construction, a less powerful motor, and higher lifetime heating costs, the difference in purchase price between the two hot tubs might make buying the less expensive one a perfectly reasonable decision.</p>
