<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks. And because swim spas are usually larger than normal spa pools you have more room for relaxing or more room for family and friends. They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>The Viton seal material is said to be more impervious to chemical wear from chlorine, bromine, ozone and other hot tub water treatments. Bromine also performs a little better in hot water of a spa. This, in fact, is not far from being accurate in that lower end hot tubs are available for between $2000 and $4000.

<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>
<p>We've had hot tubs in the past and decided we wanted something simple this time. It is advisable for people suffering from diarrhea, skin infections, intestinal infections or fresh wounds on any part of the body not to use the hot tubs. The average price of Jacuzzi bathtubs are based on their size, whether the unit can still be used as a standup shower and the number of jets they include. The lining of the Jacuzzi tub or swim spa is usually made from fiberglass or acrylic.</p>

<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>
<p>A hot tub used to be seen as a luxury item that people could only dream of owning one day. But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes.
