<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>

<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>

<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks and the Romans also all had a great love for communal hot baths fed by natural hot springs and many of these bath houses had massage facilities, sports arenas and places to eat included as well.

The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo.
