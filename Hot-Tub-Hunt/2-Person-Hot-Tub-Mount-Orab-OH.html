<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive. ThermoSpas' parent company, Jacuzzi Brands LLC (Jacuzzi”), is a global company and we may transfer your personal data to ThermoSpas affiliates within the Jacuzzi family of companies or to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak. These signs should make you a lot more cautious about buying that particular hot tub, although more often than not a lack of treating the water will not harm the performance of the spa.</p>
