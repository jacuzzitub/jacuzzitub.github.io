<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>

Here, we have collected 10 more reasons why you might need a swim spa.</p>
<h3>Ground Hot Tubs Hope Mills</h3>
<p>They hold warm water, have seating and include jets that push hot water out from all sides. The Axis Cover System by Master Spas makes swim spa covers for both your H2X and Michael Phelps Swim Spa. Also, hot tubs are pretty easy to maintain, which is what you need if it is going to be something you want to relax in. Especially if you consider it against getting something like a swimming pool which is going to take up a lot of space and be high maintenance.</p>
<p>The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>

Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side.
