Size - With most swimming pools starting at a size of 18x36', they can take up a significant amount of our space. Fiberglass whirlpools have high pressure 'jets' that create a whirlpool effect. This hot tub was the perfect balance of cost and quality. Simply put, high-end swim spas offer the best swimming experience available.</p>
