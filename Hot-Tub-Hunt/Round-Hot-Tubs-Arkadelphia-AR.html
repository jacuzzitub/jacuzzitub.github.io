<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa. Have a look at our massive range of spa pools and contact us or your local spa shop to sit in some to see how they fit.</p>
<h2>Corner Hot Tub Arkadelphia Arkansas</h2>
<p>Next to chromotherapy, hot tubs can feature built-in sound or aromatherapy systems that, through the use of essential oils or aromatic herbs, have a positive effect on your body and emotional health. Now it is time to enjoy your work, you did good, celebrate in your new hot tub. Hot tubs are usually made of wood, but they can also be made from synthetic wood materials. My husband and I purchased a swim spa from Endless Pools in January this year and are delighted with the outcome.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are usually between 8 to 12 meters long, while swimming spas are usuallybetween 4 to 6 meters. Hot tubs are a great way for families to share in relaxation. Warm water also brings down swelling and loosens tight muscles. Indoor hot tubs come in a variety of shapes and colors to match your bathroom decor. A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at horsepower, though, make sure you consider the swim spas GPM, or gallons per minute rating. The HL 8DL is a great hot tub to relax in, the Healthy Living 8 Dual Lounge provides reclined seating for two at once, 44 hydrotherapy jets, and LED lighting. But hot tubs are not all the same as one another and the qualifications of their makers differ as well. Most mid-range swim spas are also built with more equipment that is designed for swim spas.</p>

Arctic Spas has a quick sales team and lots of customizable swim spas so you can live extravagantly or find a more affordable unit that will fit your family's needs.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>One-piece hot tubs are popular because their manufacturing cost is lower than the wooden hot tubs. Size - With most swimming pools starting at a size of 18x36', they can take up a significant amount of our space. Fiberglass whirlpools have high pressure 'jets' that create a whirlpool effect. This hot tub was the perfect balance of cost and quality. Simply put, high-end swim spas offer the best swimming experience available.</p>

Portable spas are readymade spa pools that can be installed in your home, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
