<p>Our Swim Spas Store in Austin is Packed with Affordable Fitness Spas and Hot Tubs. We introduce ourselves as eminent manufacturer, supplier, retailer & trader of Jacuzzi Bathtub with DVD. Their professionalism, customer service, commitment to their spa pools and ultimately the customer satisfaction is such a rarity. Swim spas have most of the benefits of a swimming pool but can be installed into a smaller space and are much cheaper. Swim spas with a powerful current can give you the same results as working out with weights - a lower current equals less weight or crank up the speed for intense resistance.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>

Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>However it is also not advisable to spend most of your time swimming. Jacuzzi spas are warranted against water loss due to defects in the spa shell for ten years.
