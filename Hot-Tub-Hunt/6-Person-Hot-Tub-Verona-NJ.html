<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC. Other optional features in some varieties of Jacuzzi tubs include a mood light, heater, and even a water-level sensor. Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose. Both styles offer heat seam pillows that prevent heat loss through the seams of your spa and upgraded rubber grip handles.</p>

<h3>Jacuzzi Products, Collections And More Verona</h3>
<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current.
