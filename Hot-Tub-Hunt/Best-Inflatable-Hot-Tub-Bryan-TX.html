<p>When people just state that a hot tub is a hot tub and they are all the same, I get really frustrated because they are not all the same and now I will show you why. Imagine the luxury of being able to swim laps from your very own swimming pool at home. If the Paris hot tub is just a tad out of your price range, then you can still reap all the benefits of a Lay-Z-Spa with the Miami hot tub. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas, or by the trade name Jacuzzi. Some Swim Spa units are separated into two distinct bodies of water. Weight loss spas, swim spas or beauty spas indulge and pamper yourself all the way to the glory.</p>
<p>Endless Pools' swim spas range in size from 1,200 gallons up to 2,395 gallons.

Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the USA, inspired by the Japanese ofuro Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.</p>

From our design engineers in California to our tradespeople in Georgia, we take pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality.

The Jacuzzi® Hertfordshire showroom is the perfect place to experience the quality & exclusivity of this world famous brand.</p>
<p>My experience with the Jacuzzi company has been most unpleasant, If you should purchase one of their very expensive walk-in tubs and it needs repair at some point, be prepared to fix it yourself as the company has forgotten you name after the sale is made. In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are usually between 8 to 12 meters long, while swimming spas are usuallybetween 4 to 6 meters. Hot tubs are a great way for families to share in relaxation. Warm water also brings down swelling and loosens tight muscles. Indoor hot tubs come in a variety of shapes and colors to match your bathroom decor. A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>

<p>Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
