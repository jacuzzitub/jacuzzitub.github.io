<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Originated in 1970 as a commercial swimming pool company and in 1978 became one of the first hot tub retailers in North America. In tune with advanced market developments, we are providing Bathtub Repair Service. Some walk-in tubs feature heated seats to help the bather stay warm while waiting for the tub to fill and drain. If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>

Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation citation needed Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).</p>

PDC's Top Quality Acrylic Spas are set apart from other hot tubs with a full range of exclusive patented features including PDC's Temperlock energy conservation system, Air'sagge warm air therapy, Powerflo filtration, and AdvantagePack equipment flexibility.</p>
<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas.
