The Swim Spa is the perfect balance for those who want the best of both worlds, swimming and relaxing. The main parts of a hot tub pump are the wet end and the motor end.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>
