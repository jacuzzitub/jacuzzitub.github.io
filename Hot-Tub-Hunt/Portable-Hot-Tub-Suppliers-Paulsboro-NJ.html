<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa. Have a look at our massive range of spa pools and contact us or your local spa shop to sit in some to see how they fit.</p>
