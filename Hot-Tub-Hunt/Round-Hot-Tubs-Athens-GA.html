<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. Given its background, the options that Jacuzzi offers elevates bathing from a cleaning session to a bathing experience you'd find in a spa. Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean. The you must consider also that where a hot tub is subject to regular use it will accumulate natural body oils, perspiration, and other material that may mark the water line.</p>

However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
