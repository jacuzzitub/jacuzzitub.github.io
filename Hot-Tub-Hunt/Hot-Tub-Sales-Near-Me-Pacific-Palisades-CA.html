Units with such heaters cost more and do use more electricity. Jacuzzi tubs come in a variety of sizes and shapes such as round, square, oval, kidney shaped.</p>

We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
