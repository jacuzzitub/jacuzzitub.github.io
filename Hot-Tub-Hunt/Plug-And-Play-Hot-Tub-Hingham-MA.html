<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that every body enjoys so much. Bacteria like a warm moist environment to grow in. You need to make sure they don't get it. If you wear a swimsuit in the hot tub, take it off immediately when you get out. Hot tubs can rightly be considered spa treatments on a domestic scale, an ideal solution when the limited or inadequate space, or technical impediments, do not allow to have a normal size swimming pool. The Bellavista collection comes in your choice of rectangular and triangular shapes, and is available in all four of Jacuzzi's luxury tub experiences: Soaking Bath, Pure Air, Whirlpool, and Salon Spa.</p>
