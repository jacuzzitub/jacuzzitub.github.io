<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>

<p>According to promotional information we received from Hydropool, the company's self-cleaning spas like the AquaTrainer 14 fX can filter 100 percent of their water in 45 minutes. Your swim spa can be heated to the temperature of your choice. Jacuzzi may have been the first well known hot tub brand, but they may not offer the most affordable spas for sale on today's market. Shell - The part that contains the water and where you sit the body of the actual Hot Tub is referred to as the Shell.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
<p>Some of the features to look for in an all season pool that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related. This way, even though there is not an extensive amount of swimming space in a swim spa, you can still enjoy the improved health, fitness and muscle strength that swimming provides. In addition, the swimmer can adjust the direction of the water-flow for each river jet to ensure their swimming experience is perfect for their swimming style.</p>
<h3>Jacuzzi Hot Tub Parts West Hollywood</h3>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>
<p>Choose Hot Tubs Direct offers these types of tubs. Cleaning these tubs is a simple process and sometimes there is free cleaning service provided by manufacturers. However, it is important for people who own pools or hot tubs in their homes to know how to take care of them and keep themselves and their families healthy and safe. For competitive swimmers and fitness buffs, a larger swim spa could be a good investment.</p>
<p>Sure, you eat right and exercise, but to really live well, you should add in a bit of hydrotherapy with a Healthy Living Hot Tub.

<p>The benefits of swimming are well known. Next is Spa Pack to hot tub. Swim spas do enable you to enjoy swimming and hydrotherapy in even a relatively small backyard. Design, Wellbeing, Performance and Care: these are the values that constituted the essence of Jacuzzi®, a brand that anticipates needs and trends, creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet requests of any kind. The best way to find a genuine and reliable hot tub dealer is to see if they are part of BISHTA (British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association), this is a hot tub association that makes sure all hot tub dealers are keeping to the correct laws and make sure they are providing customers with safe information as well as good service to their customers.</p>

Look for a swim spa where the current spans the full width of the pool. The company manufactures hot tubs known all over the world for quality, luxury, and the health benefits of hydrotherapy.</p>
<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating.
