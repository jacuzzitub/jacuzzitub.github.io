<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>Fortunately, not many materials are needed to have a Jacuzzi bathtub installed in a home. Pumps are designed to push a high volume of water into the Jets of the hot tub, creating various hydrotherapy massage streams. However, homeowners usually end up saving money because their water heaters do not have to work overtime. There are so many great benefits you get from swimming. A pool alarm can help keep kids safe around all kinds of pools and hot tubs.</p>
<p>Look for insulated swim spas such as fiberglass units constructed with a wood core. Instead, it's niche hot tub companies like Canadian Spa, Bestway, Coleman and Essential that offer a variety of great pop-up and full-sized tub choices. We have made it our goal to be the best manufacturer of hot tubs and swim spas in the world. SwimCross Exercise Systems introduces a jetted swim option with exceptional value, from the makers of Endless Pools.</p>

<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
<p>Jets and waterfalls are also features that can come with the hot tub to add to the relaxing benefits and ambiance. Kit comes with pumps, pipelines from Jacuzzi to pump suction and from pump delivery to Jacuzzi Nozzles Header for Water with necessary fittings. Thankfully, chemicals in a whirlpool bath can kill sperm quickly, and a woman who is simply sitting in the water isn't in an active, "open" position that would allow sperm to enter.</p>
