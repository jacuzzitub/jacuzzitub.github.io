<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Some cheaper swim spas offer long warranties that look good on paper but only actually cover parts. In a series of different studies done, it has also been found that swimming is one of the better forms of exercise you can undertake if you suffer from Fibromyalgia which is a fairly common condition in which a person suffers from pain and tenderness in muscles, tendons and joints, and has been linked to chronic headaches, sleep problems, and general fatigue.</p>
<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage. Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>
