<p>A swim spa is ideal for swimming but did you know that it is an ultimate training machine? A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
