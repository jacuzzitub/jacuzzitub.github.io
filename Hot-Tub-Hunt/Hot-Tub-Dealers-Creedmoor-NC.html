<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>In case you need something much bigger, SwimEx makes the 1000 S - a multi-user swim spa that holds 7,700 gallons of water. Besides the usual Jacuzzi jets of water, the entire pool looked like the wake of the QE2. If you are looking for the best quality hot tub for your family, Jacuzzi is the brand for you. In fact, Jacuzzi is a trademarked brand of hot tubs, bath products and pool equipment.

Some destination spas also offer to plan the stay's itinerary so all you have to do is be there and get pampered.</p>
