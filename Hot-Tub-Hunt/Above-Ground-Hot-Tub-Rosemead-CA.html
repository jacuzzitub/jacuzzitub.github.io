<p>We all know that spas and hot tubs have been around for numerous amounts of years, this being said the old economical spas always had there setbacks. A massage, body treatment, or esthetics treatment is the perfect addition to your time in our world famous natural hot mineral water. Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect.

Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end.

<p>Depending on how you use the Hot Tub and the people that actually use it you should fully drain and inspect your hot tub say every three to six months. The paddlewheel current allows people to swim side by side, and there's also an area of still water for people who prefer that. We have installed spa pools across Australia, from Canberra to Brisbane, to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in. Units with such heaters cost more and do use more electricity. Jacuzzi tubs come in a variety of sizes and shapes such as round, square, oval, kidney shaped.</p>
<p>Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
