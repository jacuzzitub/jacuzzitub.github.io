<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year. Soaking in your hot tub can be a true panacea for your health. Swim spas have this feature wherein you can swim in place for as long as you want.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in. However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>

<p>As time progressed though, the average price of a portable hot tub spa shot way up, mostly because of all the new features and advanced technology that was being built into them.

If your Jacuzzi bathtub comes with a built-in filtration and water purification system, maintaining your hot tub should be a breeze.

The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming.
