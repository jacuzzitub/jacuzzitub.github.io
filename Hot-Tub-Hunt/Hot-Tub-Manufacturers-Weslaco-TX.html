<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. If you want to improve your fitness, relieve pressure on your body or melt away the stresses of daily life, an Endless Pools Swim Spa is the intelligent option. It is true that athletes can exercise, relieve muscle tension and improve their over all athletic performance through the use of a swimming pool and spa. Because of their flexible designs, modern hot tubs can be used in a multitude of settings. Many articles and clinics cover the intricacies of how this can be improved however; stroke rate or tempo is of equal importance for faster swimming.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>

<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are usually between 8 to 12 meters long, while swimming spas are usuallybetween 4 to 6 meters. Hot tubs are a great way for families to share in relaxation. Warm water also brings down swelling and loosens tight muscles. Indoor hot tubs come in a variety of shapes and colors to match your bathroom decor. A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>
