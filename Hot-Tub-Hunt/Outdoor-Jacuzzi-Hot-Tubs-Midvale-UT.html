<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>Also, our Jacuzzi bathtub is designed using topmost grade material and progressive technology in conformity with latest market trends. Due to the hot, damp environment that occurs around a swim spa, even the hardiest of timbers will be susceptible to mold and mildew. You do not drain the water from a hot tub after each use. Jacuzzi tub brings the health benifits too. Swim spas provide space for kids to move around. Adding to Jacuzzi's fabulous range of therapy tubs and installation types are its innovative technologies.</p>

Take your rejuvenating swim hat is available within just a few steps away from you without all the worries many who go for pools suffer from. Now that's not to say that your hot tub might not be a Jacuzzi brand or it might even be sold by a company who refers to spas or has the word spa” in their name.</p>
<p>We want to be seen as the brand spearheading innovations in swimspa technology, like our hydraulically balanced plumbing which ensures the correct water pressure to the hydrotherapy jets or the WaveRider Control. Lucky for you, a swim spa can offer a more controlled environment to help your kids learn the basics of swimming. They can also look more attractive than swim spas, thanks to the extensive range of exterior cladding and pool colour choices they offer.</p>
<p>Therapool has up to three jets that go along with the resistance of the water so you get the best workout possible.

<p>Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
<p>You are going to want to invest a bit of energy in putting it away where it is free from accumulation of dust and particles so that you experience a more comfortable spa session each time you use it. The number of motors and pumps is in direct relation to the actual size of the Hot Tub the number of jets and the degree of therapy delivered. Hydrotherapy is a therapeutic whole-body treatment that involves moving and exercising in water; essentially physiotherapy in a pool.</p>
<p>Relaxing in a warm jetted hot tub is very relaxing and good for your mental health. Ensure you have plenty of space to fit the hot tub, as well as easy access to the power source and enough room to safely get in and out of the hot tub. Hydropool has swim spas for relaxing, working out and even a little bit of both. Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>

Jacuzzi keeps things simple by only offering two walk-in tub lines: the Jacuzzi Walk-In Tub and the Finestra Bathtub.</p>
