<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow).
