<p>There are different types of swimming pools and they are named based on their usage. Whether it's a more affordable model you seek or a swim spa with extras - like a built-in LCD TV screen and ice bucket perfect for keeping refreshments cold - we welcome you to come to our showroom and browse our excellent options available in swim spas. The smaller volume of water is less maintenance to keep clean and swimming pools can't typically provide hot water for use throughout the colder months of winter.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

Often there are steam rooms, ice rooms and saunas and these are usually accompanied by iced plunge pools, foot spas and often experience showers”. There are two types of jets used in jetted bathtubs, water jets and air jets.</p>
<p>For decades, the name Jacuzzi” has been synonymous with any contained body of water which includes water jets to aid relaxation. A Swim Spa is essentially an over-sized spa with an added current. Often times, you will hear a hot tub referred to as a jacuzzi. While there are a few things to learn, with a little training and ongoing advice from a reputable retailer it will take just a few minutes per week to keep your swim spa clean and ready to use at any time.</p>

A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>It has 20 powerful stainless steel jets, contoured seating for up to five people (although five is a more reasonable max), has a heat pump that plugs into a normal outlet, and holds 241 gallons of water. So as to become a preferential business name, we are thoroughly engrossed in shipping an inclusive collection of Whirlpool Jacuzzi Spa. Some also offer dual-temperature control where you can set one side of the swim spa to a comfortable swimming temperature and the other side to a temperature more suited to hydrotherapy.</p>
<p>Even the discount factory warehouse chains sometimes seem to lure you in with a low price in a newspaper ad, then try and talk you out of buying the advertised one and spending instead on a top of the line hot tub. We introduce ourselves as an eminent manufacturer, supplier, retailer & trader of Acrylic Bathtub that is fitted with stylish faucets and gives proper drainage system. Endless Pools' swim spas create a current using a 16-inch propeller, and the current it makes is stronger than those created with jets.</p>
