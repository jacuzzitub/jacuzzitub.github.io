<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
<p>Neither of these options add major benefits to your overall spa experience. Many people do jogging and running exercises, but swimming is a popular alternative for those who either don't enjoy running or might have joint issues, as exercising in water produces less stress on your legs and joints.
