<p>Does your spa or hot tub smell? When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration.

<p>Coast Spas Hot Tubs and Swim Spas are optimized for superior Wellness. In this article, we're going to take a closer look at the many benefits of Hydropool Swim Spas. If space is no problem, you may want to consider a larger unit like the one to the left (16' or larger) that has two separate sections molded into it. Realize that these style units may be a bit more costly because they need two completely separate filtering, pumping and heating systems.</p>

<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in. Units with such heaters cost more and do use more electricity. Jacuzzi tubs come in a variety of sizes and shapes such as round, square, oval, kidney shaped.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
