<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground.

The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets. One method is to time a "stroke cycle", starting a watch when the swimmer's right arm enters the water and stopping the watch when the right arm re-enters the water. In the 1980s, swim spas were invented, yet they didn't come popular until the last decade.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces.
