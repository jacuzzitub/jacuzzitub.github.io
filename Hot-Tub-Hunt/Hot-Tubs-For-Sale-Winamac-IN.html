<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>

<p>One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>
<p>Many public pools require women and men with long hair to wear a swim cap while in the pool. Salt can clog the motor that powers air or water jets on other brands or rust out the pump or heater. Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa.
