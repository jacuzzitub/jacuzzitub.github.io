Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>Reviews indicate that the hard resin base gives it better insulation than inflatable hot tubs, but the cover is harder to keep snapped in place.
