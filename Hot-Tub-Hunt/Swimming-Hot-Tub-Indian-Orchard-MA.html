<p>A hot tub is a large home made or manufactured tub filled with hot water. The next part would be the swimming pool part. Now here's where it gets a little confusing, so stay with me. Whirlpool Bath is a trade name owned by Jacuzzi for their brand of jetted tubs, as in a Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath for the master bath. Flexible PVC piping is used in all quality spas. He considers swim spa workouts an excellent way for seniors to improve their fitness. Run it to the spa and fill with hot water.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>

<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off‚Äù the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level. As already mentioned, in addition to the standard equipment, hot tubs can be equipped with extra accessories like the devices for chromotherapy and aromatherapy. These are super-strong fibreglass pools with ceramic cores, manufactured to the very highest standards using the latest in swimming pool technology.</p>

Many people would love a sound system in the hot tub as well TV but many can not afforded these luxuries and therefore looking for a cheap hot tubs.

For beginning swimmer of for anyone looking to improve his or her swimming form, it provides added stability and assistance in maintaining your body position in the current.</p>

Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people.
