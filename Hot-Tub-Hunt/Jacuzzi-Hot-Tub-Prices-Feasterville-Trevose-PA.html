<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct.

Another thing to remember if you are thinking of buying an indoor hot tub is that, although they are more convenient, indoor hot tubs require more complex installations than traditional outdoor ones.</p>
<p>Sure, you eat right and exercise, but to really live well, you should add in a bit of hydrotherapy with a Healthy Living Hot Tub. With a large volume of water like this (between 600-2000 gallons depending on the size) it will be somewhat costly to heat up to hot tub temperatures though. In 2001, the JacuzziÂ® bathroom brand was expanded in the UK to include sanitaryware, premium shower enclosures, furniture, brassware and accessories to offer a full contemporary bathroom collection.</p>
<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>

The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off.
