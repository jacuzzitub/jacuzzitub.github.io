<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use.

<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool.

Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>
