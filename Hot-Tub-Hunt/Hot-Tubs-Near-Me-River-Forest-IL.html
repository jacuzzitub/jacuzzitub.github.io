<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Originated in 1970 as a commercial swimming pool company and in 1978 became one of the first hot tub retailers in North America. In tune with advanced market developments, we are providing Bathtub Repair Service. Some walk-in tubs feature heated seats to help the bather stay warm while waiting for the tub to fill and drain. If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>

Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>

For people looking to rid their bodies of excess toxins and water, a jacuzzi provides a great opportunity for body detoxification.</p>
