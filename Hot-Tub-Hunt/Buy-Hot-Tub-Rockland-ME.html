<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>For example, people with multiple sclerosis should avoid a swim spa because warm water can exacerbate symptoms, while people with arthritis tend to prefer a pool that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. People often wonder when is the best time to buy a hot tub, and the answer can vary depending upon several factors. The pump within your spa pool determines the overall quality and functioning of your whole spa.</p>

You can have self-contained and "portable" unit, you can just get a Swim Spa shell and set it into a deck, you can have a customized Swim spa made for you or you can get a Swim Spa Water Jet and install it into your existing above ground or inground swimming pool. This is obviously very important for your hot tub's long-term efficiency and the water's cleanliness.</p>

<p>We already know that the tubs can promote better blood circulation. It is also time to start filling the hot tub.

Portable hot tubs provide the same experience and fun as a standard hot tub. Hot tubs with an ozonator will help sanitize your hot tub, while hot tubs that have a stereo will let you enjoy some relaxing music.</p>

Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>
