Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>Not only is this warm air recycled and used to warm the water in your jets, but it also helps to maintain the water temperature and thus saves energy and indeed the user money as it will help to reduce the electricity used. You can get a spa package before planning out your vacation or just book yourself when you check in. It is advisable to call ahead and make bookings, as sometimes hotel spas run full.
