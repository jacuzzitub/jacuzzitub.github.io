<p>Dehydration or hypohydration refers to the loss of water within the body. Specialty treatments at Hot Springs Resort and Spa are a true experience in decadence.

<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Swim spas vary dramatically in cost depending on size, jet power, features and installation. They have this feature wherein an adjustable water current will be applied in the pool part so you can swim laps and laps without hitting the walls nor turning around. Get all these things right and you will never regret buying a Jacuzzi tub, so seek professional help when selecting a hot tub for your home - you can often try them out at the dealers shop too.</p>
