<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>

Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets.
