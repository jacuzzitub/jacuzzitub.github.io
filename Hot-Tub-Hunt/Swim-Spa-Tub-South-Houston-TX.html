<p>With a Balboa hot tub, life is simpler and happier - just the warm water and you communing to drive the stress away from your mind and eliminate the toxins from your body. Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage. Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
<p>The air jets on a Spa system will be on the bottom of your bath. Hot tubs are available with both cottages holidays, and lodge holidays. Forget about the anxiety of public pools, the drive to fancy spas to pamper yourself, or searching for physical therapy centers. Sometimes all the water jets may automatically move or rotate, again providing the effect of a massage. Warm water is known to soothe muscles. A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>
