<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The company's history can be traced back to the mid-20th century when the Jacuzzi brothers invented an underwater pump that could be used to relieve pain in arthritis patients. Endless pool - swim spa promises a laminar current where you can even choose to have rowing equipment or an underwater treadmill to upgrade your normal swimming workouts The water carries most of your weight effortlessly for you to be able to perform any kind of exercises or workouts that you desire.</p>

The pump within your spa pool determines the overall quality and functioning of your whole spa.</p>
