<p>Whether you are anxious about swimming classes for you or you are afraid for the safety of your children, swim spas offer an opportunity for private swimming classes. This is a feature that allows a Jacuzzi to keep the water in the tub warm. This is not limited to just swimming, but also includes underwater aerobics, aquatic therapy, weight lifting and other water-based exercise routines. PDC's Top Quality Acrylic Spas are set apart from other hot tubs with a full range of exclusive patented features including PDC's Temperlock energy conservation system, Air'sagge warm air therapy, Powerflo filtration, and AdvantagePack equipment flexibility.</p>
<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms. Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing. You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>
<p>The circuit breaker can also trip if there is a problem with the ozonator or air blower of your hot tub. SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>
