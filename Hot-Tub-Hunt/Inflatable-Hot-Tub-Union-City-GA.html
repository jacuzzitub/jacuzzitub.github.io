<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets. If there is dealer does not know the name of what parts are used in their hot tub or it's a name you have not heard of it best to keep clear of their particular tubs.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

Shell - The part that contains the water and where you sit the body of the actual Hot Tub is referred to as the Shell.</p>
<p>Hot tub covers should always be on the Jacuzzi when not in use, keeping excess dirt and dust out of the water and jets, keep wandering children out of the water (many are lockable) and reducing heat loss to keep your bills as low as possible. Texas Hot Tub Company is the top choice to find quality Jacuzzi Spas in the DFW area. Use the word spa to describe going for a spa break” or if you are lucky enough to have, or know anyone that has a permanent, in the ground, hot tub.</p>
