<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>

Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV.

<h3>Which Hot Tub Is Best For Me Statham</h3>
