<p>My experience with the Jacuzzi company has been most unpleasant, If you should purchase one of their very expensive walk-in tubs and it needs repair at some point, be prepared to fix it yourself as the company has forgotten you name after the sale is made. In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
