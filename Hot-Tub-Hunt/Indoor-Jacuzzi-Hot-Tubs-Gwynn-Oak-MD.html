<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water. Environmental reasons for spa & hot tub odors are due to the build-up of bio-films on spa surfaces and plumbing lines that contribute to the formation of White Water Mold and Pink Slime and all of their odors. Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub owners in the GTA, Kitchener, Barrie and London are provided with a world-class hot tub ownership experience - for life.

<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
