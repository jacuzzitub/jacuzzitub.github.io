<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive.

Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa.
