<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>The Company offers hot tubs and accessories, such as covers and lifts, synthetic accessories, hot tub complements, and water purification systems. During the 1960's, Roy Jacuzzi took over the business and then started marketing and selling the first Jacuzzi hot tub using the same jet systems that was invented by this family. You may want to consider how many people you will need to accommodate, budget and available space designated for your hot tub.</p>
