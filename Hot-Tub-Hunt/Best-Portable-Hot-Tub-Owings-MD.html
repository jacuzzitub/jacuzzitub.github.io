Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>

<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
<p>During our research, we learn about swim spas made by well-known companies. If you're not working with a professional swimming pool cleaning services company, consult your owner's manuals for help with start-up procedures. Water maintenance is imperative when using hot tubs. If you find you still need to get to the workings of the hot tub, you can try building a wooden panel to cover that side, and making a number of wooden planters to put nearby as well, to help blend the whole thing in together.</p>

<p>High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas.
