<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>Many swim spas come with a PH tester kit, but you can also purchase one separately. The Ergo Group deals with the finest quality outdoor and luxury products and is proud to partner with Jacuzzi® through Hydrolife. Likewise, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect luxury item that will help you increase the overall value of your home. The plumbing system of all Vortex swim spas is warranted against leaking for 5 years. If you've never learned how to swim you should take lessons at your local pool to learn the basics, but after that it is simply a matter of swimming length after length.</p>
<p>It is said that hot tubs helps people by making the blood circulate better. Next to that there are headrests, water fountains, sound systems and thermal covers for a 360° wellness experience. Most swim spas sold in Canada will set you back between $10,000 and $50,000 CAD. Steamy hot tubs can also pose a risk of Legionnaires' disease , a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>

<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa.

Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>

An advantage of having a small hot tub is that it makes it a lot easier to get it into gardens as many small tubs are designed to be fit through a standard door therefore there is no expense for a crane to get the tub into the garden and it makes it easier to carry the tub into your garden.</p>
<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>

<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>Experimental men have been known to get a bit aggressive with whirlpool jets, and some men have been caught with their delicate parts entrapped. As swim spas are relatively compact, they can be a good solution if you do not have a lot of space in your backyard. Recently our local factory warehouse ran a newspaper ad and featured a hot tub on sale for $750. Soak in the hot water and it will naturally pull out toxins and excess water from your body.</p>
