<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets.

<p>You can add a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit to most inground or above ground pools and instantly have a Swim Spa water current in your existing pool. Induce yourself in the wellness of hydro massage, Chromo therapy, and air massage offered by Oyster bath, the leading spa bathtub manufacturers. In 1968, Roy Jacuzzi invented the first format of a self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath that attracted number of people to luxuriate in its relaxing spray of waters.</p>
<p>So hot tubs are really nothing new but they have evolved tremendous amounts. Our swim pools offer our attractive styles that are visually appealing for any backyard environment. Clearwater Spas are proudly made in the U.S.A. since 1976. People suffering from heart disorders or certain types of skin ailments must consult their physicians before using any kind of sauna. As the name implies, a steam sauna uses water that is poured over rocks and heated to produce steam, whereas an infrared sauna uses infrared waves to heat the interior and your body.</p>
<p>Some of the features to look for in an all season pool that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related. This way, even though there is not an extensive amount of swimming space in a swim spa, you can still enjoy the improved health, fitness and muscle strength that swimming provides. In addition, the swimmer can adjust the direction of the water-flow for each river jet to ensure their swimming experience is perfect for their swimming style.</p>

Just relaxing in the hot water relieves stress and fatigue from the mind and body, and after strenuous exercise or work, soaking in these waters eases stiffness and pain of the muscles and joints, helps increase circulation and oxygen flow and has been known to help most circulatory illnesses.</p>
<p>A system of heaters and jets keep it bubbling, which create satisfying massaging sensation and eventually work as an excellent anecdote to anxiety and stress. Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>

Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>

<p>All our Hot Tubs include standard delivery and installation to your base and power supply, as well as including a cover, chemical starter kit and two tier steps. Yes, our swim spas come is a variety of sizes. When purchasing your spa pool, we urge you to ensure the spas shell construction follows the above details. The first time I encountered a hot tub was when I was house-hunting with my wife. In 1968, Jacuzzi incorporated the hydrotherapy pump into the inside walls of its tubs, which created the first ever self-contained whirlpool.</p>
<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
