<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that every body enjoys so much. Bacteria like a warm moist environment to grow in. You need to make sure they don't get it. If you wear a swimsuit in the hot tub, take it off immediately when you get out.

Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation citation needed Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).</p>
<p>However it is also not advisable to spend most of your time swimming. Jacuzzi spas are warranted against water loss due to defects in the spa shell for ten years.

The hot tubs on today's market have a pump that circulates the water through pipes and then out of underwater Venturi jets.</p>

<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet.

The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>
<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table.

Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>
