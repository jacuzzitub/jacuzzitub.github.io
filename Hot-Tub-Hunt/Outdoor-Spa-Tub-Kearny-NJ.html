<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks. And because swim spas are usually larger than normal spa pools you have more room for relaxing or more room for family and friends. They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>Great for aching muscles or a sore back, the calming heat of a spa combined with jets for massage is the cure to any bad week. The ALL NEW Premium swim spa line was created to improve the quality of life for you and your family. Perimeter lighting with 15-20 single LED's around the water line of the spa or swim spa.

Whether it be relaxing in one of many different spas and hot tubs, enjoying a soothing sauna tub, this can help make your family gatherings a joy.</p>
<p>Bathroom was spacious and the tub was a nice feature. Like cars, not all swim spas are alike. You could also purchase the Jacuzzi Bath Tubs that have the model number of BA06. Single zone swim spas with 2 or 3 jet pumps require a 32 amp direct wired power supply (and isolation switch) and dual zone and professional swim spas require up to 60 amps (dual zone swim spas will supply two separate power supplies). A jet system creates a smooth current of water ideal for fitness activities, and massage jets offer relief from stress, aches, and muscle pain.</p>

<h3>Portable Hot Tub Spa Kearny NJ 07032</h3>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>

<p>The circuit breaker can also trip if there is a problem with the ozonator or air blower of your hot tub. SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>
