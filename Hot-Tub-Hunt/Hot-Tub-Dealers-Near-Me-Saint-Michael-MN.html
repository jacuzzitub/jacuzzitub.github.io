<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. The choice ranges from more classic wood-covered hot tubs, for a timeless elegance, to the most glamorous ones with faux leather covering, conceived to resist bed weather. There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather. Some of the features to look for in a swimspa that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related.</p>
<p>The innovative bowed sidelines of the Kona , Sport and Splash Series are more comfortable than conventional swim spas, creating a more spacious swim area with greater freedom of movement. An Endless Pools® Fitness System and Swim Spa from the makers of Hot Spring® Spas, truly is a versatile option for the backyard. Ultimately, the warranty that a supplier is prepared to offer on their product is the best judge of the quality of the spa and how long you can expect it to last.</p>

In addition, swimming against swim jets is a very different experience to swimming against a natural water current. So if your swim spa's shell structure fails anytime within the 10 year warranty, we replace it. No questions asked.</p>
<p>Look for pools that offer a strong, adjustable current so you to change the water from a low speed for easy workouts and rehab to higher speeds for full intensity swimming or fitness routines.
