<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>

<h3>Huge Hot Tub Dayton TX 77535</h3>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Because they use a heavy gauge vinyl liner inside the steel wall panels (just like a standard steel wall inground swimming pool), you are not constrained by a mold. PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization. There are dangers to buying used spas, and if the hot tub is not set up and running so you can test the pump, heater, and other features, then you might be very disappointed when you get it home and set up.</p>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
