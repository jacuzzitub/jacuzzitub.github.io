<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people.

Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
