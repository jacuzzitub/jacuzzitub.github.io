<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>

In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
