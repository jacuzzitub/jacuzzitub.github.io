<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content. Visit Paradise Spas & Outdoor Living, we serve the Greater Austin area, including Cedar Park Texas, and are excited to offer these unique products.</p>

Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
