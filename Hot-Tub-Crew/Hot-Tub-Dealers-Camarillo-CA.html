<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC. Other optional features in some varieties of Jacuzzi tubs include a mood light, heater, and even a water-level sensor. Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose. Both styles offer heat seam pillows that prevent heat loss through the seams of your spa and upgraded rubber grip handles.</p>

A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>
<p>The hot water massage stimulates the body and encourages it produce stress-relieving endorphins. Levitator Jets mimic this additional force by helping to push your body upwards, providing you with a more natural way to swim in place.

This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water. For example, the first time you use your new tub and try to remove its bulky 7'x7' cover, you will quickly understand the value of a hydraulic cover lifter: a device that makes it a breeze to open and close your cover.
