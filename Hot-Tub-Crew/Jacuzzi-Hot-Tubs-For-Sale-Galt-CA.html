Whether you're simply too busy or feel outnumbered by your troubles, a personal hot tub is an easy way to find peace and comfort without travelling hundreds of miles away.

We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter.
