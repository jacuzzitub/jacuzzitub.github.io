Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak.

<p>They gave me a great price on the hot tub and the entire experience was great. Besides hydromassage, there are hot tubs with chromotherapy that, thanks to underwater lights, emit rays of colored lights able to infuse energy and balance while ameliorating the mood.

And then there are the independent hot tub sales events which are not only paying thousands for their space and everything else mentioned above for a three-day event…but they have extremely high costs for their aggressive TV advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Some of our swim spas have seating along the sides of the spa as well like myLapswim This gives more room for people to sit and enjoy a massage but reduces the pool area at the swim jet end.

PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization. There are dangers to buying used spas, and if the hot tub is not set up and running so you can test the pump, heater, and other features, then you might be very disappointed when you get it home and set up.</p>
<p>The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water.

<p>The Viton seal material is said to be more impervious to chemical wear from chlorine, bromine, ozone and other hot tub water treatments. Bromine also performs a little better in hot water of a spa. This, in fact, is not far from being accurate in that lower end hot tubs are available for between $2000 and $4000.
