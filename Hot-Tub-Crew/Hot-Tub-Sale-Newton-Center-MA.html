<p>This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas.

<p>Vortex Spas are the best value, high quality spas available anywhere in the world.

These tubs offer you the same relaxing feeling that a hot tub does. 1. 3 HP Water pump (2 pumps), 2 circulation pumps and 41 jets.</p>
<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms. Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing.
