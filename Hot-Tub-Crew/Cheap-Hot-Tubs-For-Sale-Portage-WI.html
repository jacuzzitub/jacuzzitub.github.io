<p>You don't have to be a swimmer to get the benefits of an exercise pool. On the other end, a pair of powerful swim jets produce one of the smoothest swim currents in the industry, fully adjustable for any level swimmer, with a backlit buoyancy jet that illuminates the swim current and combines the perfect amount of air to elevate the swimmer into the ideal position. Our collection of swim and fitness spas are the pinnacle of performance and style providing improved wellness and a better quality of life conveniently at home.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit.

With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
