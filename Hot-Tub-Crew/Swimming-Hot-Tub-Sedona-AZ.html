<p>Jacuzzi is a large bath or a pool like structure that is equipped electrically to sprout jets of water and air bubbles from different points at the occupants. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>Choose Hot Tubs Direct offers these types of tubs. Cleaning these tubs is a simple process and sometimes there is free cleaning service provided by manufacturers. However, it is important for people who own pools or hot tubs in their homes to know how to take care of them and keep themselves and their families healthy and safe. For competitive swimmers and fitness buffs, a larger swim spa could be a good investment.</p>

<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation.
