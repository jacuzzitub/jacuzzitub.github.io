<p>Nothing feels quite so good after a physical workout - or even just after a hard day at the office - than sinking into a nice hot tub(HT) and feeling those jet sprays pulsing against the skin. The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
