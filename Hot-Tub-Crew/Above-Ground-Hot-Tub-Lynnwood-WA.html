<p>The risks involved highlight the importance of using the correct chemical products for your pool and swim spa. Gone are the days where hot tubs are placed in one spot and stay there indefinitely. You should also remove and clean the Hot Tubs filter thoroughly making sure you remove any contamination.

Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space.
