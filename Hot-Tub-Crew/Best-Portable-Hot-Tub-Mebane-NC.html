<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat. We put family with a firm focus on kids at the forefront of our mind when we set about designing our range of swim spas. Before any piece of Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment leaves the factory, it is thoroughly tested in a state-of-the-art facility. Quality spas provide their owners with years of use and reliable performance.

There are hot tubs made for only one, and they go up in size from there. The word spa refers to a tub filled with water that has heat for the water and jets to spray the water and circulate it throughout the tub.</p>
