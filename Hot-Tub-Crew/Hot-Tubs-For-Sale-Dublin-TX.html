<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Hydropool's Self-Cleaning 670 is a 6-person hot tub with a comfortable lounger and a great leg massage. In a garden or on a terrace, in the bathroom, in the living area or even in the bedroom; hot tubs can be installed both indoor and outdoor, ensuring multi-sensory enjoyment either when alone, or in company. The swimming pool alternative for any backyard. They can be above ground (like one of our portable spas shown here), they can be sunk into an indoor floor or outdoor deck, or they can even be part of an inground swimming pool (known as a pool and spa combo).</p>
<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period. Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>The heat widens blood vessels, which sends nutrient-rich blood throughout your body. With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps.
