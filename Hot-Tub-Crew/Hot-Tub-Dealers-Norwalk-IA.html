<p>When you have made the decision to buy a Hot Tub then you have to consider carefully where you will locate the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing.

Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
