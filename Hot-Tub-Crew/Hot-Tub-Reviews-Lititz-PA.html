<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive. ThermoSpas' parent company, Jacuzzi Brands LLC (Jacuzzi”), is a global company and we may transfer your personal data to ThermoSpas affiliates within the Jacuzzi family of companies or to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Drink water while in the hot tub to cool off your body. We also have many videos right here on our web site where you can see Swim Spas in action, right from your own computer screen. Relaxation is important during pregnancy, and since there are few better ways to relax, you may be tempted to swim in a swim spa or soak in a hot tub. This is the hot tub side of the spa. Watch Part Two of this brand new video from which takes you through the plumbing, jetting, insulating and cabinetry necessary for every hot tub spa or swim spa.</p>
<h2>In Ground Spa Lititz Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Since inventing the whirlpool tub in 1956, Jacuzzi® brand products continue to set the standard for powerful performance, enduring quality and hassle-free operation. Not only do these high pressure jets massage the body, but they increase blood circulation and can be a form of subtle exercise. Check out our range of hot tubs, spa pools and swim spas, then get in touch and talk to our expert team about getting your spa dream underway.</p>
<p>In North America it is law for any commercial establishment to have a closed pressurized filtration system on any public pool or hot tub. All Vortex spas feature perimeter insulation that's designed to minimise heat loss. Whether you call it a Spa or a Hot Tub, we have the perfect one for your needs. Whether you're interested in a form of socializing or a powerful way to rejuvenate and refresh your mind and body, Jacuzzi® hot tubs will leave you fully satisfied.</p>

<h3>Hydropool Swim Spas At Jacuzzi Outdoor Living Lititz</h3>

<p>Originated in 1970 as a commercial swimming pool company and in 1978 became one of the first hot tub retailers in North America. In tune with advanced market developments, we are providing Bathtub Repair Service. Some walk-in tubs feature heated seats to help the bather stay warm while waiting for the tub to fill and drain. If you are buying the swim spa for a family-type, year-round pool, you might not worry too much about having a strong current.</p>
<p>When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>
<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety. The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>

<p>When hot water runs out, wait a half hour for the water heater to recover and do it again. Making sure hot tubs have the right levels of disinfectants is essential to preventing Legionella infection, the agency says.

<p>One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas. Most people see improvement in their symptoms when they simply stop going in hot tubs, but some people may need treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, according to a 2006 study from the Mayo Clinic. On Endless Pools' website, you can build your own swim spa and see a price quote right away, making it the only company we evaluated that posts all prices up front.</p>
<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
