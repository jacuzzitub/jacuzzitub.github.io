<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore.

<p>Some of the features to look for in an all season pool that can provide this type of an experience are fitness related. This way, even though there is not an extensive amount of swimming space in a swim spa, you can still enjoy the improved health, fitness and muscle strength that swimming provides. In addition, the swimmer can adjust the direction of the water-flow for each river jet to ensure their swimming experience is perfect for their swimming style.</p>
<p>This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
