<p>Hot tubs and spas are becoming increasingly more popular and they are to be found in many homes. The Following Atlantic City hotels features Jacuzzis, some are included in every room and a few hotels have specific room types that contain the Jacuzzi experience. The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets. One method is to time a "stroke cycle", starting a watch when the swimmer's right arm enters the water and stopping the watch when the right arm re-enters the water. In the 1980s, swim spas were invented, yet they didn't come popular until the last decade.</p>
