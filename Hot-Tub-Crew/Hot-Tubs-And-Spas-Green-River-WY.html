Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump.

Swimming pools make a great sand-less alternative, but laps in a public pool aren't always possible, and, of course, not private, and installing and maintaining your own pool may be too costly, not to mention the fact that you can't take it with you if you move or you may simply not have the space to accommodate one.</p>
