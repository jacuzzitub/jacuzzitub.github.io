<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive. ThermoSpas' parent company, Jacuzzi Brands LLC (Jacuzzi”), is a global company and we may transfer your personal data to ThermoSpas affiliates within the Jacuzzi family of companies or to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Drink water while in the hot tub to cool off your body. We also have many videos right here on our web site where you can see Swim Spas in action, right from your own computer screen.

<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period. Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
