<p>Hot tubs come in various sizes ranging from the cute, two person "Soft Tub" to the very large multiple person party units. Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use.
