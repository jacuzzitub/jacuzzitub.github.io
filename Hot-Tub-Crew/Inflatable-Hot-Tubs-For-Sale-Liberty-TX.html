<p>We all know that spas and hot tubs have been around for numerous amounts of years, this being said the old economical spas always had there setbacks. Built with strong and durable materials, Jacuzzi spas will operate at a consistently high level, assuring you reliable, energy-efficient performance for years of worry-free hot tub enjoyment. What's more, if you combine stretching or water exercises with your time in the hot tub, you can enhance the pain relieving and healing benefits of your spa. Marquis' Ownership Protection Plan is simple to understand and completely outlines the coverage of your brand new Marquis Hot Tub.</p>

<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining. Another little-publicized benefit is that swim spa workouts can help people improve their balance, according to another 2018 article by Rick McAvoy.</p>

<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>This step completes the 4 layers found in the shell of a quality spa pool. The position of the jets also determines how the tubs can concentrate on certain parts of your body. The extra-wide, open shell design creates the ideal swim channel with virtually no reflective wave while stabilizing hip jets further ensure the perfect swim experience.

<p>Legendary for performance, reliability, and ease of use, they set the standard by which all hot tubs are measured. Hot tubs might not be safe for pregnant women because they increase body temperature. In general, for swim spas the base must be able to support 1000kg per square metre and this requires a level slab that is 50mm (6”) minimum thickness with F72 reinforcing mesh.

<p>High-end swim spas are also generally larger than mid-range swim spas and include added hydrotherapy and fitness options that aren't found in other swim spas.
