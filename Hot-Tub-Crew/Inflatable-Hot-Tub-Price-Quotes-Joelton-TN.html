<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>We provide this Massage Bath Tubon several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers. Even if you don't add a heat pump when buying your swim spa, make sure this technology and plumbing is in place as an option down the track.

Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget.

As explained above, in the ‘What is the best filtration system for your spa pool” section, there are three main types of pumps, two-speed, single speed jet and single speed circulation. Unlike any other quality of hose, this particular PVC piping has the ability to withstand the spa pool environment of temperatures between -26 and +70 degrees Celsius.</p>

However, it is important for people who own pools or hot tubs in their homes to know how to take care of them and keep themselves and their families healthy and safe.

Design, Wellbeing, Performance and Care: these are the values that constituted the essence of Jacuzzi®, a brand that anticipates needs and trends, creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet requests of any kind. The best way to find a genuine and reliable hot tub dealer is to see if they are part of BISHTA (British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association), this is a hot tub association that makes sure all hot tub dealers are keeping to the correct laws and make sure they are providing customers with safe information as well as good service to their customers.</p>

<p>We consider the styles and sizes of swim spas each company makes as well as the number of spas available, the kinds of water jet propulsion systems used and price range.
