Replacement covers and cover lifts are also included in Jacuzzi for Life, just give Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs Ontario a call and make an appointment for your replacement.

Jacuzzi is a trademarked brand of hot tubs and other products. We build our swim spas to be used year-round in every possible climate using environmentally friendly Icynene foam insulation.</p>
<p>Exercise in general will increase the amount of air taken into the lungs, but swimming in particular can make a big impact. I would recommend Spa World (especially their swim spa range) to anyone that is weighing between a spa and a pool. With three airless jets, comfortable seating for the whole family, 27 hydromassage jets, and generous recreation space, harmony between work and play is possible. All Jacuzzi® brand bathtubs are made from the highest quality acrylic.</p>

Whether you choose an inground or above ground swim spa, the safety regulations are the same as they would be for a full-sized swimming pool.

<p>It is said that hot tubs helps people by making the blood circulate better. Next to that there are headrests, water fountains, sound systems and thermal covers for a 360° wellness experience. Most swim spas sold in Canada will set you back between $10,000 and $50,000 CAD. Steamy hot tubs can also pose a risk of Legionnaires' disease , a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
