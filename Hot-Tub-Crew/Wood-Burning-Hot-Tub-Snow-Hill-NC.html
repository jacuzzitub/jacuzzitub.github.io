SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>
