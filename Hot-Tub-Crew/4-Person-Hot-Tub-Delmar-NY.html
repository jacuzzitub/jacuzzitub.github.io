The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets. One method is to time a "stroke cycle", starting a watch when the swimmer's right arm enters the water and stopping the watch when the right arm re-enters the water. In the 1980s, swim spas were invented, yet they didn't come popular until the last decade.</p>
<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period.
