<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>

Compared to a swimming pool a swim spa requires much less space in your home or garden, yet despite the smaller footprint provides even the strongest swimmer a fantastic swimming experiences all year round. At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>
