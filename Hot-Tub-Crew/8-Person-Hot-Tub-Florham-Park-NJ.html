That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>It has the performance and style synonymous with Jacuzzi®, and is the ideal introduction to the many benefits of hydrotherapy that its classic jets can deliver. You still get jet options to concentrate water sprays to various parts of the body for a soothing water massage. Jacuzzi pump parts and most any type of seals are available online, but be sure to get the right kit for your particular pump type and brand.</p>
