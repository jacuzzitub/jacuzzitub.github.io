<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. For those who really need exercise and can't just go for a run, a swim spa may be the answer. Spa Tacular Hot Tubs first opened its doors for business in 1999.

<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>
