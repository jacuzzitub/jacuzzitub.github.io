<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>
<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>

<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time.
