<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs. For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>

<p>The two-in-one design of these fitness and exercise pools gives you the best of both worlds through gentle resistance for laps and after you're finished-hydromassaging jets to soothe your muscles. Audio and visual options are offered in the majority of spa pool and swim spa deals today. The filtration system in your spa pool is vital for providing you with pristine water. The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
