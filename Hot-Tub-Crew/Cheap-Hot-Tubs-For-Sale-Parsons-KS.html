The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep.

<p>Legendary for performance, reliability, and ease of use, they set the standard by which all hot tubs are measured. Hot tubs might not be safe for pregnant women because they increase body temperature.

<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools.

I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
