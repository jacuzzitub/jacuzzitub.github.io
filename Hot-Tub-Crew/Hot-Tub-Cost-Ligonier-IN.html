<p>When considering the purchase of a hot tub, the price is not the only factor that you should take into consideration. After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body. Also the green view is one that is very much listened to by the hot tub industry resulting in much more ecological friendly Hot Tubs. By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>
<p>As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors. This is a patented technology; hence, you will not find this technology in any other ordinary swim spas. Using heat and the element of massage, Healthy Living Hot Tubs create one-of-a-kind hydrotherapy to ease aches and pain, calm stress and boost the natural healing response.</p>

When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
