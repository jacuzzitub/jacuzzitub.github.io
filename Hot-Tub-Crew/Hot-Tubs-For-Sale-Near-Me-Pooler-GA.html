<p>After reviewing several portable hot tubs, we decided the Lay-Z Spa Miami was the one we would purchase. If you swim seriously, swim jets are not ideal, as competitive swimming always takes place in natural conditions, so you will not gain a realistic idea of your times and progress if you are practising in a swim spa.
