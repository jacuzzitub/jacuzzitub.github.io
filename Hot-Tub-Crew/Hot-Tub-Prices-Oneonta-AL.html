<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. Fully adjustable current for swimming in place so you can focus on your form and never have to turn or push off a wall again. Late evenings or weekends may be times when the family can catch a few minutes together relaxing in the hot tub or spa. The purchased PFD should be tested immediately after purchase: in a swimming pool, and on the child who will be wearing it. Undoubtedly, the inclusion of a whirlpool tub in your bathroom is a huge selling point that can dramatically increase the return on your upgrade.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>

<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue.
