<p>Jacuzzi is a large bath or a pool like structure that is equipped electrically to sprout jets of water and air bubbles from different points at the occupants. With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment.

<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment.
