<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>Swim Pro Swim & Fitness Spas are precision-engineered to offer resistance swimming against a smooth current that is adjustable to your speed and ability.

Some hot tubs require lengthy installations, however we've managed to pick out a range of hot tubs that don't require that much fuss, so you can simply plug and play, turning your garden into a luxury spa in an instant.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help. This is why most people have their swim spa above ground and consider building steps or a deck around it if they want a more landscaped look. In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa.

<h3>Premium Swim Spas & Hot Tubs  Orangevale</h3>
<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
