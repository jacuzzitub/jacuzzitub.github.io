<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak. These signs should make you a lot more cautious about buying that particular hot tub, although more often than not a lack of treating the water will not harm the performance of the spa.</p>
