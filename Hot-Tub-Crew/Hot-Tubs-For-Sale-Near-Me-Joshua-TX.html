<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. Sometimes, for people who are advanced in age or are very obese or are suffering from severe arthritis, swim spas provide the only available option. An easy to follow Spa & Hot Tub heater Troubleshooting Guide. Swimming pools are a great option, but may be too large for the area in your lawn. Unlike the technology-based saunas that the West uses, the Finnish sauna uses steam generated by throwing water over heated stones within the sauna room.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>

In the following paragraphs we will detail the three most common automatic water sanitization units found in spas and swim spas today. Swim spas are cost efficient. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation citation needed Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).</p>
<p>Sure, you eat right and exercise, but to really live well, you should add in a bit of hydrotherapy with a Healthy Living Hot Tub.
