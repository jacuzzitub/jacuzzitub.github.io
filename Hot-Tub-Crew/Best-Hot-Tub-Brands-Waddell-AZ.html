<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Hydropool's Self-Cleaning 670 is a 6-person hot tub with a comfortable lounger and a great leg massage. In a garden or on a terrace, in the bathroom, in the living area or even in the bedroom; hot tubs can be installed both indoor and outdoor, ensuring multi-sensory enjoyment either when alone, or in company. The swimming pool alternative for any backyard. They can be above ground (like one of our portable spas shown here), they can be sunk into an indoor floor or outdoor deck, or they can even be part of an inground swimming pool (known as a pool and spa combo).</p>
<p>Swimming spas are typically smaller compared to the size of a regular swimming pool. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. You can step into a Jacuzzi hot tub knowing you will enjoy the benefits of hydrotherapy for years to come. However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>

<p>Hot tub covers should always be on the Jacuzzi when not in use, keeping excess dirt and dust out of the water and jets, keep wandering children out of the water (many are lockable) and reducing heat loss to keep your bills as low as possible. Texas Hot Tub Company is the top choice to find quality Jacuzzi Spas in the DFW area. Use the word spa to describe going for a spa break” or if you are lucky enough to have, or know anyone that has a permanent, in the ground, hot tub.</p>
<p>Their parts are also generally cheaper to ship and arrive sooner, reducing downtime if there is a problem with the swim spa in the future. Whilst it is possible to produce the spa's jets and other plastic components using a quantity of reused plastics, it is difficult to guarantee their fundamental quality. One of the most popular additional features that people add onto their Jacuzzi bathtubs is an independent heater.</p>

Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
