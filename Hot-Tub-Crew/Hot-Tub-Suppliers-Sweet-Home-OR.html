<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>Specialty treatments at Hot Springs Resort and Spa are a true experience in decadence. Likewise, if you plan to use your swim spa mainly for exercise, you might want to consider a spa that has an easy to control current that allows you to change the current to various strengths. The health benefits of aquatic exercise are well known as movement in water benefits body and mind. Discover pro grade performance with Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment and Cleaners.</p>
