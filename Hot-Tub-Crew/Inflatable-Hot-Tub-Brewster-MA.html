<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>The hot water in a spa helps keep your blood circulating better. Every so often, it is a good idea to consider adding a water sparkle agent to keep your hot tub looking bright and clear. Hotels are famous for advertising an in-room Jacuzzi, when it's actually a spa made by some other manufacturer. By reducing the temperature drop required before the heater switches on, Reactive Heater Control provides more consistent spa water temperatures and lowers your daily operating costs.</p>
