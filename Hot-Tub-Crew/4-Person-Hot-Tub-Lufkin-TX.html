Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>As you are swimming in the sea you should not try to work harder than you would in a regular pool. Hot tubs are usually located outdoors, although they can be installed indoors.
