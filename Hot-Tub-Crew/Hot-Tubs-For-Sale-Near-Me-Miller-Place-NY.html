With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>

<h3>Indoor Hot Tubs Miller Place</h3>
<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
