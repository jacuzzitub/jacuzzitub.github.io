In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight. From our design engineers in California to our tradespeople in Georgia, we take pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>
<p>The Helsinki AirJet from Lay-Z-Spa is a Nordic inspired inflatable hot tub which can be used all year-round thanks to the innovative Freeze Shield technology.

<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the plethora of hot tub accessories available on Wayfair that will only add to your hot tub experience. The faster the filters can clean the water , the less the swim spa will need to run when you're not using it. We liked the hard top cover and simplicity of the Eco Spas. Even though the current is strong, it will never come between you and your swim laps and workouts due to the consistency of the water flow that will never let you hit the end of the spa.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>

Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>

<p>Welcome to TidalFit — the answer to swimming, aquatic fitness and soothing massage in one. During this time, I continued to watch the growth and increase in popularity of free standing, self-contained swim spas, however, the quality and performance of these spas simply did not meet my standards and expectations. When you come back after the rental time is done, you would empty the water, and take the hot tub away.</p>
