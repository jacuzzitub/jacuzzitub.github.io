<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling.

Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump.

The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
