<p>Men who use their sauna jets for solo time may worry when their female friends come calling, especially since water in a standard tub is changed only a few times each year.

<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible.

We have all been there, training in a pool too hot or cold is not an enjoyable experience. If you keep your swim spa clean, you won't end up in germ-filled water and it will last longer, maximizing your financial and health investment.</p>
