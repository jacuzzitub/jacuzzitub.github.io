The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC.

Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose.

<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa.

<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
<p>Water constantly passes over the steel tube creating a consistent and reliable heating pattern. One of the greater benefits that comes with a swim spa is in the form of efficiency and portability.

<p>This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas.
