<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<h2>Round Hot Tubs For Sale Thomaston Georgia</h2>
<p>Lastly, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect accessory to relax sore muscles and relieve joint pain. Currently, Jacuzzi is the world's most recognized whirl pool brand name. Not only does a Vortex Swim Spa have less water to heat, but when combined with our Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump it's the most cost effective heated swimming pool option. Hot Springs Resort & Spa is excited to announce our Signature Tub Series. Something that many people don't realize, is that that the more they use their spas, the more they can save.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the plethora of hot tub accessories available on Wayfair that will only add to your hot tub experience. The faster the filters can clean the water , the less the swim spa will need to run when you're not using it. We liked the hard top cover and simplicity of the Eco Spas. Even though the current is strong, it will never come between you and your swim laps and workouts due to the consistency of the water flow that will never let you hit the end of the spa.</p>
<p>The whirlpool bath was invented in the early 1940s by Candidi Jacuzzi, a second generation Jacuzzi. It's like a hot tub - but with even more benefits. Lay-Z-Spa makes a third entry onto our list with the Monaco hot tub. These little creatures can rapidly grow their colonies, especially in hot tubs that are not well maintained, and those that do not have periodic cleaning of the water. At Master Spas, we make buying a swim spa just as relaxing as owning one.</p>
<h3>The Importance Of Swimming Pool Companies Thomaston</h3>

The ideal place for Jacuzzi tubs is in the garden or patio where you have substantial foundations to rely on. To enable all year round use you can construct a gazebo or small room around it. Windows can be used for ventilation, or to cool off on hot summer nights.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>

Some also offer dual-temperature control where you can set one side of the swim spa to a comfortable swimming temperature and the other side to a temperature more suited to hydrotherapy.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level. As already mentioned, in addition to the standard equipment, hot tubs can be equipped with extra accessories like the devices for chromotherapy and aromatherapy. These are super-strong fibreglass pools with ceramic cores, manufactured to the very highest standards using the latest in swimming pool technology.</p>
