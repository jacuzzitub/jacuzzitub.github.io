<h3>What Is A Swim Spa Peoria</h3>
<p>This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>

The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>

One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>
<p>As the company's owner since 2016, he has continued Olympic's legacy of promoting health & wellness through hot water & sauna therapy. As well as ensuring that your spa has an incorporated heat pump, make sure that the spa pool or swim spa control system has been adapted to accommodate this.

This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!).
