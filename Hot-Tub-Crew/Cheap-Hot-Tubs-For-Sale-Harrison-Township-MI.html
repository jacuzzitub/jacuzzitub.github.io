<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible. Also, swim spas require a metal frame for support (which does not like being underground) and have the equipment (which requires access) inside the cabinet. Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Made with high tech rolling technology, this energy efficient cover is extremely easy to operate and it makes taking on and off your swim spa cover easier than ever. Natural swimming pools attempt to duplicate the environment of natural swimmable lakes which are healthy, non-polluted and ecologically-balanced bodies of water. Nowadays, the one-piece hot tubs are also quite common and have many advantages as well.</p>
