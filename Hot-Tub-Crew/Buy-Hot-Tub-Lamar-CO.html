<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. Many of our customers have commented that since owning a swim spa it has reduced the amount of screen time their kids want and increased their physical activity. Come in and see our line of quality swim spas. Spa pools sit well on outdoor decked areas that flow comfortably off your house. For nearly thirty years, Endless Pools has been the top choice has been the top choice of people from casual swimmers to professional athletes all seeking an attractive alternative to in-ground pools or bulky home exercise equipment.</p>
<p>For example, people with multiple sclerosis should avoid a swim spa because warm water can exacerbate symptoms, while people with arthritis tend to prefer a pool that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. People often wonder when is the best time to buy a hot tub, and the answer can vary depending upon several factors. The pump within your spa pool determines the overall quality and functioning of your whole spa.</p>

The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>
<p>Depending on how you use the Hot Tub and the people that actually use it you should fully drain and inspect your hot tub say every three to six months.

Sometimes all the water jets may automatically move or rotate, again providing the effect of a massage. Warm water is known to soothe muscles. A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>
