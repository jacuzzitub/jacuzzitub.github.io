<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks.

There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>
