<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat. We put family with a firm focus on kids at the forefront of our mind when we set about designing our range of swim spas. Before any piece of Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment leaves the factory, it is thoroughly tested in a state-of-the-art facility. Quality spas provide their owners with years of use and reliable performance. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa by Master Spas combines the benefits of water exercise with the therapy of a hot tub so you can own your wellness and win your day.</p>

<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>The latest hot tubs have superior ozone systems resulting in the use of much less chemicals. This open-concept tank is large enough to offer many of the benefits that swimming pools do. Often, companies that offer swimming pool cleaning services recommend lowering the water level for winterizing. Key questions to answer when shopping for a hot tub are how many people will be using it at one time, and where you plan to place your hot tub.</p>

Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes.
