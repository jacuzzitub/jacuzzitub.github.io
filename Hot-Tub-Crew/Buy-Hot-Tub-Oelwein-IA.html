In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>

Most importantly, cheap swim spas are prone to shell failure which will require a potential warranty claim if it needs to be replaced. The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
