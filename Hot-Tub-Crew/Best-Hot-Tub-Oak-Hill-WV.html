<p>If you like meeting new people and being in business for yourself, than this is a business that I think would be a really fun business to set up, and do. Especially going to people's houses, and working and setting up soft tubs & hot tubs for them. The J-500 Collection Combining innovative technology, ground-breaking design and legendary Jacuzzi® hydromassage, The J-500® Collection establishes a new standard in backyard luxury. Your time with us in the Canberra show room was not only educational to operating a spa, but also the benefits in purchasing a Spa World spa. A bathroom size of 2.8 m by 2.8 m is sufficient enough to fit in a Jacuzzi and leave enough space around it.</p>

Hotels are famous for advertising an in-room Jacuzzi, when it's actually a spa made by some other manufacturer. By reducing the temperature drop required before the heater switches on, Reactive Heater Control provides more consistent spa water temperatures and lowers your daily operating costs.</p>

Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
<p>With the combination of heat and humidity, and water - your body is more than likely losing water while swimming. Lastly, if the Jacuzzi tub does not have a self-cleaning feature, then it will require extra cleaning because even a little bit of water left in the tubing can lead to mold growth and spread of bacteria.
