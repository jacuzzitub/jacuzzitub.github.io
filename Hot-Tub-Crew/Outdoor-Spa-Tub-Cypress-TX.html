<p>When people just state that a hot tub is a hot tub and they are all the same, I get really frustrated because they are not all the same and now I will show you why. Imagine the luxury of being able to swim laps from your very own swimming pool at home. If the Paris hot tub is just a tad out of your price range, then you can still reap all the benefits of a Lay-Z-Spa with the Miami hot tub. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas, or by the trade name Jacuzzi. Some Swim Spa units are separated into two distinct bodies of water. Weight loss spas, swim spas or beauty spas indulge and pamper yourself all the way to the glory.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>

We opt for centralised manufacturing in our one factory near to Barcelona, which produces thousands of hot tubs and hydromassage tubs each year for the world's most demanding markets.</p>
<p>For decades, the name Jacuzzi” has been synonymous with any contained body of water which includes water jets to aid relaxation. A Swim Spa is essentially an over-sized spa with an added current.

<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak.

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
