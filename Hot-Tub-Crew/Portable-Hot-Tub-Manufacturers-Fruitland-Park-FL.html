<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground.
