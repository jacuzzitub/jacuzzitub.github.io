Jacuzzi TheraPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. You can step into a Jacuzzi hot tub knowing you will enjoy the benefits of hydrotherapy for years to come. However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
