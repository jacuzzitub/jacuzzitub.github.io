<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
<p>When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>

Use the word spa to describe going for a spa break” or if you are lucky enough to have, or know anyone that has a permanent, in the ground, hot tub.</p>
<p>Product offerings include whirlpool baths, outdoor hot tubs, showers, sanitary ware, bath tubs, as well as fixtures and accessories. Allow the water to drop and keep a close eye on it. Turn off the jets and slowly let the water drop in the tub. A perfect example of the confusion that exists: a hot tub, to me, is not a spa, and it's certainly not a Jacuzzi. Jacuzzi keeps things simple by only offering two walk-in tub lines: the Jacuzzi Walk-In Tub and the Finestra Bathtub.</p>
