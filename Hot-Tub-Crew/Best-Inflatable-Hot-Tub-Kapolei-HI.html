<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive. ThermoSpas' parent company, Jacuzzi Brands LLC (Jacuzzi”), is a global company and we may transfer your personal data to ThermoSpas affiliates within the Jacuzzi family of companies or to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<h3>The Anatomy Of A Hot Tub Pump Kapolei</h3>
<p>The jets are useful for water massage or hydrotherapy. A water current generated by five turbo jets enable swimmers to swim counter current and thus keep fit. If you are hiring a hot tub for that special occasion for a loved one, a small gathering or a large event, hot tubs are a perfect way to make it an event to remember. Websites such as Lowe's or Home Depot have a wide range of indoor Jacuzzis and whirlpools.</p>
<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa. This is not very critical in the maintenance of your Hot Tub but of course, a pleasing visual appeal of clear water will considerably add to the experience. Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa.

<p>Multiple conditioning grills smooth and redirect the water, resulting in a swim current that is free of turbulence. Jacuzzi designed the CLEARRAY water purification system, which uses an exclusive ultraviolet light filter to remove bacteria from your spa water. A swim spa can combine all the wonderful, healthful properties of swimming that a lake, ocean, or pool can as well as those of a spa in which you can relieve yourself of the stresses of your day.</p>

<p>In terms of price, portable hot tubs are more affordable than regular hot tubs. This allows a person, or pet, to soak in warm, relaxing water, while still swimming and exercising against a legitimate current and with plenty of space. An apple cider vinegar soak in a hot tub can help stop itching skin related to allergies or other dermatitis, as well as helping to take the heat out of a sunburn. A 2018 article on the company's website lists the health benefits people with no serious ailments can derive from a home swim spa: improved sleep, reduced stress, faster recovery from injuries, weight maintenance, reduced muscle pain, increased muscle strength and better flexibility.</p>

In a series of different studies done, it has also been found that swimming is one of the better forms of exercise you can undertake if you suffer from Fibromyalgia which is a fairly common condition in which a person suffers from pain and tenderness in muscles, tendons and joints, and has been linked to chronic headaches, sleep problems, and general fatigue.</p>
<p>All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!).
