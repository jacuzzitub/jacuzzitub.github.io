You should also consider a location that will minimize the mess of water, because an indoor hot tub makes it easier to get out of the tub and walk through the rest of the house before drying off. You can customize most swim spas with steps, an ozone or bromine filtration system, cover or various colors of internal shells and external cabinet.</p>
