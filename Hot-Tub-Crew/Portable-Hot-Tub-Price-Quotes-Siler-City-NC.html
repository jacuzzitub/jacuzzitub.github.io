<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area.

If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa. Have a look at our massive range of spa pools and contact us or your local spa shop to sit in some to see how they fit.</p>

<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak. These signs should make you a lot more cautious about buying that particular hot tub, although more often than not a lack of treating the water will not harm the performance of the spa.</p>

<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming.
