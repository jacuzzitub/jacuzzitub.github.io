Aquatic exercise in a swim spa can be helpful for people with chronic conditions, but Schulte said it varies by person.

<p>Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi.

You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
<p>A spa provides the powerful combination of massage and hot water. Fully programmable using the control panel, the jets allow you to set your endless pool for your fitness and strength. There are three main types of pumps to be aware of when deciding on a spa pool. Multiple hot tub users may shade off innumerable bacteria into the water unknowingly.
