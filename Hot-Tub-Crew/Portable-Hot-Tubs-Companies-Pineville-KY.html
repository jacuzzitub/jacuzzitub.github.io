<p>Introducing the all-new Endless Pools® Fitness Systems. The Synergy Series feature two high-powered Elite Pro jets for a variety of family fun and fitness opportunities. On this website, you will get lots of information related to the best types of hot tubs. If the spa you are considering does not offer this it is likely a sign that they have not used quality products in the manufacturing of their jets.

Kids love swimming under the twin laminar water feature jets. These jets actually push air into the tub instead of water causing a gentle massaging feeling.

<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
