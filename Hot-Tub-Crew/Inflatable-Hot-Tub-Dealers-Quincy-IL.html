The Vortex control system will adapt and tune itself to the thermal properties of your spa pool and its environment, day to day, season to season, this will reduce 'on-demand heating'. As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together. Sensing the American consumers interest in health, fitness and leisure activities, Roy invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath in 1968.</p>
<p>Men who use their sauna jets for solo time may worry when their female friends come calling, especially since water in a standard tub is changed only a few times each year. This alternative to a pool has benefits for you and your entire family. When comparing hot tubs it is recommended to ask the hot tub dealer what the name of the parts manufacture as there are only a few manufacture of good quality hot tubs parts.</p>

<p>Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are usually between 8 to 12 meters long, while swimming spas are usuallybetween 4 to 6 meters. Hot tubs are a great way for families to share in relaxation.

<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
