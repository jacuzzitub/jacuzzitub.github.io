<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Hydropool's Self-Cleaning 670 is a 6-person hot tub with a comfortable lounger and a great leg massage. In a garden or on a terrace, in the bathroom, in the living area or even in the bedroom; hot tubs can be installed both indoor and outdoor, ensuring multi-sensory enjoyment either when alone, or in company.
