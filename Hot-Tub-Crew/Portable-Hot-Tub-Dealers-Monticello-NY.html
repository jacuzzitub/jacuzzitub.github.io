<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it.

<p>A Jacuzzi is a large circular bath which is fitted with a device that makes the water move around.

The Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code is a model code developed by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials ( IAPMO ) to govern the installation and inspection of plumbing systems associated with swimming pools, spas and hot tubs as a means of promoting the public's health, safety and welfare.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
