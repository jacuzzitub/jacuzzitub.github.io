<p>Jetted bathtubs are gaining in popularity. This step completes the 4 layers found in the shell of a quality spa pool. The position of the jets also determines how the tubs can concentrate on certain parts of your body. The extra-wide, open shell design creates the ideal swim channel with virtually no reflective wave while stabilizing hip jets further ensure the perfect swim experience. All Endless Pools® Fitness Systems and SwimCross Exercise Systems feature a durable, two millimetre galvanised steel frame and ABS base pan which together provide superior support and protection from ground contact.</p>
<p>A proper insulated cover is essential for a Hot Tub whether it is indoors or outside.

Just outside the back door, you can have an amazing temperature controlled pool and hot tub in one - the perfect space for light aquatic exercise followed by rejuvenation and allover relaxation. If the hot water jets are on, sit on the opposite side where the water temperature is slightly lower.</p>

<p>As always when making a major purchase, however, it is essential to do your research and check that you are purchasing a good quality swim spa which will last a long time and be safe to use. Chlorine and bromine are both excellent sanitizers used in spas and hot tubs. Indoor hot tubs eliminate the awkwardness of using the tub in front of neighbors or passersby. Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>
<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>
