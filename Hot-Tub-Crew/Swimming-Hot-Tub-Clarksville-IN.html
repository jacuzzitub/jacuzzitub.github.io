<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content. Visit Paradise Spas & Outdoor Living, we serve the Greater Austin area, including Cedar Park Texas, and are excited to offer these unique products.</p>
<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>

Due to the wiring of many spas not being capable of supporting a large pump as well as the heater at the same time, a ‘load shed' setting is adopted or the heater is simply turns off completely while the spa is in use.</p>
