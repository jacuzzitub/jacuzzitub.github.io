<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter.
