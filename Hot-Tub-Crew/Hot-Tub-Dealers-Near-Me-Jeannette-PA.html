<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas.

This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>

Emerging yourself into the warm waters of a Hot Tub or Spa can actually help your health. It doesn't hurt to sit in a bathtub of hot water because your upper body generally is not fully submerged and the materials used to build tubs cool the water quickly, unlike swim spa materials and systems.</p>
