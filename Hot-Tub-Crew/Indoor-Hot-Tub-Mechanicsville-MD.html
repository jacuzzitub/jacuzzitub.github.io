A backlit buoyancy jet helps maintain ideal swimming position while stabilizing hip jets ensures the swimmer remains centered in the swim lane.

<p>As always when making a major purchase, however, it is essential to do your research and check that you are purchasing a good quality swim spa which will last a long time and be safe to use.

<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water.

At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>
