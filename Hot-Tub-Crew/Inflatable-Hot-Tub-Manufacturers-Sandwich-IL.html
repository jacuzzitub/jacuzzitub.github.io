<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. For those who really need exercise and can't just go for a run, a swim spa may be the answer. Spa Tacular Hot Tubs first opened its doors for business in 1999. Our Team always strives to find innovative solutions to make the hot tub experience easy, fun and unforgettable for our customers.

Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining. Another little-publicized benefit is that swim spa workouts can help people improve their balance, according to another 2018 article by Rick McAvoy.</p>
