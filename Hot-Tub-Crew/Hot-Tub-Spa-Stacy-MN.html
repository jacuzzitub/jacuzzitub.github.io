<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>

It's a good idea to consult your insurance agent and ask specifically what and how your policy would cover claims on the hot tub and how much liability insurance they recommend.</p>
<p>Some cheap Hot Tubs which are usually cheap imports from the East claim to have many Jets but many times there are just simple pin point Jets, which do not rotate, or cross fire and are un-adjustable and in my view not really worth having but can look very enticing to a prospective purchaser. The best advice is that you should see any used hot tub jacuzzi in full working action before you agree to buy it. If, when you go to see it and it is empty of water or is disconnected from the electricity then you should obviously arrange for another visit or wait for it to be reconnected and filled up with water, and turned on.</p>
