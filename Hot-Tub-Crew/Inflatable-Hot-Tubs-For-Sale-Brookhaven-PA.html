<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi. Designed for ease of use, durability and carefree maintenance, hot tubs deliver a lifetime of pleasure, wherever you are. Each seat is tactically fitted with various types of massage jets in different positions, mounted in a way to massage every part of the body.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>

Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>

The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
