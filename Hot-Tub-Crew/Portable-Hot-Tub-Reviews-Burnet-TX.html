<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>One penis rash (which can also be found elsewhere on the body) that can develop in a hot tub that is not properly clean is called hot tub rash (aka pseudomonas folliculitis). After a busy week, the family wants a small entertainment together and getting into the swim spa is one of the best ways to do so. The H2X is also a great fun center for all the family members. Certain chemicals, such as chlorine and bromine, can kill germs in swim spas, pools and hot tubs as long as proper pH and disinfectant levels are maintained.</p>
