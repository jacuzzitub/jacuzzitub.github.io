<p>The Balboa Water Group is widely known for its lines of equipment, accessories and control system for the leisure water industry. In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight. From our design engineers in California to our tradespeople in Georgia, we take pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>
