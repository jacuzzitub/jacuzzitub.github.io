<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.

This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>

<p>Of course, every Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a spa. Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers.

At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>
