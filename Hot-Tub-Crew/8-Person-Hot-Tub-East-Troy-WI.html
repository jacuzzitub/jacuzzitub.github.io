Jacuzzi spas' plumbing components are warranted against leaks due to defects in workmanship or materials for five years.

The spa tubs have a purification system attached to it. This system ensures that the water that enters the tub is cleaned of all contaminants.

<p>Swimlife is in the swimspa business for life and the only way to ensure success is to produce, offer and innovate the highest quality swimspas possible.

Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>
