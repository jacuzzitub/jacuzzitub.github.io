<p>Does your spa or hot tub smell? When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration. This means trying out the spa with water in it to see if the seats are comfortable, if the jets are to your liking and if the controls are easy to operate. This hot tub includes a hardtop cover, filters, and curbside delivery from most stores. For beginning swimmer of for anyone looking to improve his or her swimming form, it provides added stability and assistance in maintaining your body position in the current.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>

Many swim spas also offer the option of swim jets in addition to the hydrotherapy jets. Baths, swimming pools, jacuzzi are turned off 10 minutes to closing of the Aqua Park.</p>
