Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
<p>A proper insulated cover is essential for a Hot Tub whether it is indoors or outside. Jacuzzi's Whisper+ technology features a patented pump system that absorbs half of the vibrations and cuts the tub's heating and pump systems sounds in half.
