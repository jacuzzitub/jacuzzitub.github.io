<p>A dip in the warm water of a hot tub can help to soothe tight, sore muscles, and ending a date in the Jacuzzi might allow couples to relax and share intimate time in a whole new way. Medical research is finding that there are many benefits in the use of hot tubs for many people with health problems. If you want to get the most out of our Jacuzzi, the water heater model is right for you. Jacuzzi® is the worldwide leader of hydrotherapy and Spa, and a benchmark for the wellness market. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tubs are shipped from Georgia, Ohio for delivery across North America. Using the 3 jets to swim, the 4 spa seats or just relaxing in the water with just the array of coloured lights tuned on the swim spa is everything and more we expected it to be. Great for exercise and great for relaxing.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa.

The design features five jets - three on top for resistance and two underneath for lift - that create a smooth, air-free current for superior low-impact, total-body exercise. Look for a swim spa that insulates both the water in the swim spa and the outer cabinet.</p>
<p>Their parts are also generally cheaper to ship and arrive sooner, reducing downtime if there is a problem with the swim spa in the future. Whilst it is possible to produce the spa's jets and other plastic components using a quantity of reused plastics, it is difficult to guarantee their fundamental quality. One of the most popular additional features that people add onto their Jacuzzi bathtubs is an independent heater.</p>
