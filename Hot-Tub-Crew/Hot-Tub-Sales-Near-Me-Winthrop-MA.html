<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub. Now, this was fine for a number of years until, of course, spas started springing up in hotels and sports complexes and going to the spa” (yah!) just like the Romans did became cool again. Go for a more powerful spa pump if you have a bigger jacuzzi or the pressure of water in your area is relatively lower. After hitting the slopes in Irownwood, use your hot tub to aid in repairing sore muscles and injuries. Hotel Spas - These are the same as the above the only difference would be it may come in with your all inclusive package where you would get unlimited treatment, drinks and food.</p>

<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool.

<p>You want to stay hydrated while soaking and drinking a cool glass” of water, fruit juice or tea is such a pleasant way to go. But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking. Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>

<p>Four pumps give this piece of equipment a lot of water flow, for therapy and exercise. Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV.
