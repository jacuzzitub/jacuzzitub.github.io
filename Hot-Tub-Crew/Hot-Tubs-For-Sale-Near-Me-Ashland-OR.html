The jetted bathtubs that use water jets force the bath water through the jets. One method is to time a "stroke cycle", starting a watch when the swimmer's right arm enters the water and stopping the watch when the right arm re-enters the water.

The $90 price tag is expensive, but if you perform weekly tests, the chemicals should last for several years.</p>
