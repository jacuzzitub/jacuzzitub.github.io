<p>3. Length of time in business - If a company started manufacturing 2 years ago and is offering a 10 year warranty, even they cannot be sure that the spa will last for it's warranty period. Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water.

But hot tubs are not all the same as one another and the qualifications of their makers differ as well. Most mid-range swim spas are also built with more equipment that is designed for swim spas.</p>
<h3>Garden And Outdoor Hot Tubs And Spa Kenner</h3>
<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well.

<p>With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub.

The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
