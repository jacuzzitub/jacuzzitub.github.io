<p>Now, these hot tub spa reviews do have their limitations. Built-in hot tubs , on the other hand, imply more charges for installation, since they require a pit and a niche for inspection running along the perimeter.

<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar. We only needed ten shifts in the water (two of our teammates only had to swim once), which I thought was pretty impressive for a group of mostly-first timers. It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas.
