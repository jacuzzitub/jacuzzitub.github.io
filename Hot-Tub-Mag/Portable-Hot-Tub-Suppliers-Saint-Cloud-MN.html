However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>

<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>We consider the styles and sizes of swim spas each company makes as well as the number of spas available, the kinds of water jet propulsion systems used and price range. Our research shows PDC Spas is the best place to buy a swim spa because of its large selection, strong swim current systems, quick customer service and many fun options. Another important task is testing and adjusting the alkalinity of the water because if your water is hard, you'll end up having to replace swim spa parts.</p>
