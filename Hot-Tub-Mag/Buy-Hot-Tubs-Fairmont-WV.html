<p>Those of us who regularly use a Hot Tub Jacuzzi know the very many benefits that one receives and if you have not tried one then you must take the time out to submerge your self in the natural warm water therapy to find out what you are missing. Adding a Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump to your spa will give you the lowest possible heating costs. Ideal for full-body relief, the J-475 JACUZZI® Hot Tub's 5-6 seat configuration offers the ultimate in style with a relaxing, extra-wide illuminated waterfall, plus an at-a-glance indicator light, color touch screen control panel, and stunning Pro-Finish cabinetry accented by corner lighting.
