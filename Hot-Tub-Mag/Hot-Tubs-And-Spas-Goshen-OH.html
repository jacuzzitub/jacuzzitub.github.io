If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them. Swim spas can come with either one or two tanks. After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot.

<p>2nd Day Air Shipping not available for chemicals, spas, and other items that normally ship by freight. 1. choose pumps with single speed jet and circulation, 2.

Since hot tubs have been around for years, and the first fiberglass, vacuformed acrylic spas were made in 1982, look for a hot tub dealer that's been in the business for a long time, and you probably can't go wrong.</p>
