Traditional swimming pools have been around for quite some time - as have hot tubs and spas. The benefits of Jacuzzi for Life allow you to experience the benefits of Jacuzzi® Brand hot tubs for a long time to come.</p>
<p>It's also possible that you might be wanting to build a permanent hydrotherapy pool maybe as an addition to your own pool in your garden in which case this would be referred to as a spa. Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
<h2>Hot Tub Hire Shelton Washington</h2>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
<p>Many swim spas come with a PH tester kit, but you can also purchase one separately. The Ergo Group deals with the finest quality outdoor and luxury products and is proud to partner with Jacuzzi® through Hydrolife. Likewise, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect luxury item that will help you increase the overall value of your home. The plumbing system of all Vortex swim spas is warranted against leaking for 5 years. If you've never learned how to swim you should take lessons at your local pool to learn the basics, but after that it is simply a matter of swimming length after length.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
