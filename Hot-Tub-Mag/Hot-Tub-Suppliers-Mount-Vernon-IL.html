<p>When you own a hot tub or spa you certainly need to make sure you have some protection for it such as one of the quality spa covers that are available. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa.

<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
