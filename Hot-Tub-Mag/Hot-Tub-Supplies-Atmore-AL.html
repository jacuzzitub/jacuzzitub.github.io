<p>Soaking in a hot tub, especially when it's cold outside, bring forth both a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive. ThermoSpas' parent company, Jacuzzi Brands LLC (Jacuzzi”), is a global company and we may transfer your personal data to ThermoSpas affiliates within the Jacuzzi family of companies or to third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>

This is an infection of hair follicles; although it is most commonly caught from an unclean hot tub, it can also occur from an unclean swimming pool, using a loofah sponge that contains the bacteria or wearing a diving suit or swim clothes that are infected.</p>
<h3>Hot Spring Spas & Hot Tubs Atmore</h3>
<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing. When spas are created with less than 4 layers it will be made evident through the shorter warranties that accompany the spa pool as its lifespan will be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>The innovative bowed sidelines of the Kona , Sport and Splash Series are more comfortable than conventional swim spas, creating a more spacious swim area with greater freedom of movement. An Endless Pools® Fitness System and Swim Spa from the makers of Hot Spring® Spas, truly is a versatile option for the backyard.
