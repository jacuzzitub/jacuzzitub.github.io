These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water. For example, the first time you use your new tub and try to remove its bulky 7'x7' cover, you will quickly understand the value of a hydraulic cover lifter: a device that makes it a breeze to open and close your cover.
