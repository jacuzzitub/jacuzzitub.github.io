<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>The maintenance of the spa is of great concern to all the owners of swim spas. Known for innovation, Jacuzzi is the company that started the modern hot tub industry. Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub. The best thing about a Swim Spa is that it eliminates the need for a full-sized swimming pool and a spa and thus cuts back on the amount of space needed.</p>
