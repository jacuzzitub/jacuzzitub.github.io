Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content.

And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative.

Unlike any other quality of hose, this particular PVC piping has the ability to withstand the spa pool environment of temperatures between -26 and +70 degrees Celsius.</p>
