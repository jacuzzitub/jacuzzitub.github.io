<p>Many people use the word Jacuzzi to describe a hot tub or spa, but in fact they are incorrect as Jacuzzi is a brand name. Exercise isn't the only pastime when there's a swim spa at home. With all commercial hot tubs found in hotels, gyms and health clubs they are mandatory to list the full set of safely points next to the hot tubs for all users to read.

<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle.

This type of hot tub is located in the privacy of your home so it is only viewable to people you are already comfortable with.

Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference.

<p>Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge.
