<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>You even hear stories of people that buy cheap eastern hot tubs and they do not get the cover for the hot tub till months later. Aquatic exercise in a swim spa can be helpful for people with chronic conditions, but Schulte said it varies by person. The Balboa Water Group also offers various parts for the maintenance, upgrading and repair of the hot tub, said parts of which will include hydromassage jets, LED lights for chromatherapy, blowers, heaters and pumps, to name just a few.</p>
