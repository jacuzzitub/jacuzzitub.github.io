<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
<p>Proper swimming pool maintenance can prevent common problems such as green pool water, cloudy water, pool staining, itchy eyes, pungent chlorine smell and the spread of various waterborne diseases. The simple fact that SwimLife Swimspas accommodate more functionality than similar-sized competitive models. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or "endless" swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
