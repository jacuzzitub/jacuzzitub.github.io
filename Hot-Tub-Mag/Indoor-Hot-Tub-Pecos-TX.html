<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>

<h3>The Anatomy Of A Hot Tub Pump Pecos</h3>

<p>A spa or hot tub should be shocked with the appropriate sanitizer after use. Hot tub water chemicals, especially chlorine have a specific formula that lasts in hot water won't turn the water cloudy and has the right pH for hot tubbing.
