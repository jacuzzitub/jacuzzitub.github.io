<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year. Soaking in your hot tub can be a true panacea for your health. Swim spas have this feature wherein you can swim in place for as long as you want.</p>
<p>First of all, Jacuzzi bathtubs are extremely expensive, costing anywhere from $600 to over $15,000 depending on the features they offer. All brands will have different features and components to make them different from other hot tub brands. Hot tubs can be installed in two different ways, either freestanding or inground. Our wider safety access steps and flat stepping areas at both the jet and seating end of the swimspas is functional and astietically pleasing.</p>

<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>

This means the area of the pool which you can practically use for swimming can be considerably less than its overall dimensions suggest. 1. 3 HP Water pump (3 pumps), 2 circulation pumps and 111 jets.</p>
<p>Their parts are also generally cheaper to ship and arrive sooner, reducing downtime if there is a problem with the swim spa in the future. Whilst it is possible to produce the spa's jets and other plastic components using a quantity of reused plastics, it is difficult to guarantee their fundamental quality. One of the most popular additional features that people add onto their Jacuzzi bathtubs is an independent heater.</p>

Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV.
