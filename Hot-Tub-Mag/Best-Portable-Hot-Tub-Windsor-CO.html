<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>

<h3>What To Look For When Buying A Hot Tub Windsor</h3>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>
<p>First this is something that can help you solve a lot of the problems of the day as you take the time to relax in your hot tub at home after a long days drive, or a long day at the office. The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone. For more intensive swimming pool cleaning services, purchase a small, portable pump to remove standing water from the cover.</p>

<p>2. 24 hour circulation pumps-These pumps function by using a small pump to force water through the heating and filtration system.
