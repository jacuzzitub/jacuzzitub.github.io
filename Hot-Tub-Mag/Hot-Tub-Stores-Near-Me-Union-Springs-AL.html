<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. Many of our customers have commented that since owning a swim spa it has reduced the amount of screen time their kids want and increased their physical activity. Come in and see our line of quality swim spas. Spa pools sit well on outdoor decked areas that flow comfortably off your house. For nearly thirty years, Endless Pools has been the top choice has been the top choice of people from casual swimmers to professional athletes all seeking an attractive alternative to in-ground pools or bulky home exercise equipment.</p>
<p>Each of the Jacuzzi® hot tubs in the J-300 collection comes with a ProClarity filtration system and a CLEARRAY® purification system. Hot Springs Resort and Spa has a licensed and professional Massage Therapists and Estheticians that provide a variety of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments. Swim spas are an excellent way to get a full body workout in a compact space and are perfect for people that love swimming, but don't have room for a large swimming pool.</p>

<p>Lastly, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect accessory to relax sore muscles and relieve joint pain. Currently, Jacuzzi is the world's most recognized whirl pool brand name. Not only does a Vortex Swim Spa have less water to heat, but when combined with our Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump it's the most cost effective heated swimming pool option. Hot Springs Resort & Spa is excited to announce our Signature Tub Series. Something that many people don't realize, is that that the more they use their spas, the more they can save.</p>
<p>Our Michael Phelps hot tub covers are designed for energy efficiency, featuring a 5-inch thick design that tapers off to 3 inches. Now, thanks to Hydroglow it's very easy to have your swim spas light match your colourful personality. This means the area of the pool which you can practically use for swimming can be considerably less than its overall dimensions suggest. 1. 3 HP Water pump (3 pumps), 2 circulation pumps and 111 jets.</p>
<p>The hot water massage stimulates the body and encourages it produce stress-relieving endorphins. Levitator Jets mimic this additional force by helping to push your body upwards, providing you with a more natural way to swim in place.

<h3>Jacuzzi Pro Grade Pool Equipment Union Springs</h3>
<p>All of the patients were men, and all of them saw improvement in their symptoms when they avoided hot tubs. We can help you find the perfect hot tub from Arctic Spas® and more. Your retailer should be able to recommend vendors experienced in working on and around a swim spa. When you soak in hot water, your body can't sweat. Available in a range of specifications and sizes, all HydroPool swim spas come equipped with their own heating, filtration, underwater lighting and water purification systems.</p>
<p>The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body. Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>
<p>My experience with the Jacuzzi company has been most unpleasant, If you should purchase one of their very expensive walk-in tubs and it needs repair at some point, be prepared to fix it yourself as the company has forgotten you name after the sale is made. In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
<p>Ask any family with a Vortex Swim Spa and they will tell you the kids absolutely LOVE THEM. From the jetted seats to do a massage for your muscles, the dual zone with hot and cold water, and the temperature control panels to offer a great healing experience for tore muscles, pains, and cramps. By producing a continuous current, swim spa water pressure encourages continuous swimming motion, producing a more effective exercise regimen.</p>

With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools.
