<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>

Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>

<p>Water remains calm in a swimming pool, which can encourage walking or standing over a more active swimming experience.
