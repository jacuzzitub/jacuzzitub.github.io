<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety. The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>

<p>Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
<p>In most cases, these swim spas cost less an $2.00 a day to operate. If you ever had a chance to relax in a Jacuzzi tub, you must know what it can do to help your mind and body.

<p>So hot tubs are really nothing new but they have evolved tremendous amounts. Our swim pools offer our attractive styles that are visually appealing for any backyard environment. Clearwater Spas are proudly made in the U.S.A. since 1976. People suffering from heart disorders or certain types of skin ailments must consult their physicians before using any kind of sauna.
