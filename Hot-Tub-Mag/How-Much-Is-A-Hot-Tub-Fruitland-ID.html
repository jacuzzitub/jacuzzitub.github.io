<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area.

Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>
<p>In the pool most people simply swim lengths and you can choose whether to swim for a set amount of time, or a number of lengths. Hot tubs must always ALWAYS be kept clean.
