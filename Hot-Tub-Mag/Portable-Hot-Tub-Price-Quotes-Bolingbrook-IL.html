<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not about anxiety, it might be that maybe you can't find any good nearby pools or any pools at all.

To give you a genuine swimming experience the X-Series delivers stronger resistance and less turbulence than ordinary jetted swim spas. We are the largest manufacturer of hot tubs and hydromassage tubs in Europe, with 30 years of experience.</p>

Many swim spas also offer the option of swim jets in addition to the hydrotherapy jets. Baths, swimming pools, jacuzzi are turned off 10 minutes to closing of the Aqua Park.</p>
