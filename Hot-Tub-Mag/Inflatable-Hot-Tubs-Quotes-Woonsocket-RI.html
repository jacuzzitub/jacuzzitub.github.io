<p>Jetted bathtubs are gaining in popularity. This step completes the 4 layers found in the shell of a quality spa pool. The position of the jets also determines how the tubs can concentrate on certain parts of your body. The extra-wide, open shell design creates the ideal swim channel with virtually no reflective wave while stabilizing hip jets further ensure the perfect swim experience. All Endless Pools® Fitness Systems and SwimCross Exercise Systems feature a durable, two millimetre galvanised steel frame and ABS base pan which together provide superior support and protection from ground contact.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>

Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
