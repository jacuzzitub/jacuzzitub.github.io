<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
<p>Next to chromotherapy, hot tubs can feature built-in sound or aromatherapy systems that, through the use of essential oils or aromatic herbs, have a positive effect on your body and emotional health. Now it is time to enjoy your work, you did good, celebrate in your new hot tub. Hot tubs are usually made of wood, but they can also be made from synthetic wood materials.

Many people who suffered from injuries, especially in their legs, that prevented them from walking properly, have chosen to start learning again how to walk in pools. And secondly, by placing the insulation between the spa's pumps and you, you'll enjoy a quieter, more tranquil and restful spa experience.</p>
