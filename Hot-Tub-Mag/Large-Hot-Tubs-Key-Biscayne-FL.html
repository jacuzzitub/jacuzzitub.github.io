<p>Today, hot tubs are more popular than ever and the number of hot tub owners is steadily rising. The therapy depends on the movement of water for a massage, buoyancy and the laminar current for relaxing your muscles, and the right temperature to offer a wholesome experience. Jacuzzi tubs can also be extremely noisy when in use. In fact, the only tool you will need to install your very own swimming pool is a screwdriver. If you're interested in purchasing a spa, swim spa, plunge pool or Infrared Sauna for your home, but unsure about what is required, please don't hesitate to give us a call today.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>The next part would be the swimming pool part. Now here's where it gets a little confusing, so stay with me.
