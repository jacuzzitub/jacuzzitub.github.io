<p>When considering which model or Spa brand to buy the question has to be asked is it true that the number of Jets in a Hot Tub really matter or is it a question of how these Jets are designed to produce that ever so nice hydro massage effect that every body enjoys so much. Bacteria like a warm moist environment to grow in. You need to make sure they don't get it. If you wear a swimsuit in the hot tub, take it off immediately when you get out. Hot tubs can rightly be considered spa treatments on a domestic scale, an ideal solution when the limited or inadequate space, or technical impediments, do not allow to have a normal size swimming pool.

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
