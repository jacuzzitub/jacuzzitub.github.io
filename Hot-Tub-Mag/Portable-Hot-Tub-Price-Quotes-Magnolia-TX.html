<p>Does your spa or hot tub smell? When it comes to finding the best swim spa, you need to take the current into consideration. This means trying out the spa with water in it to see if the seats are comfortable, if the jets are to your liking and if the controls are easy to operate. This hot tub includes a hardtop cover, filters, and curbside delivery from most stores. For beginning swimmer of for anyone looking to improve his or her swimming form, it provides added stability and assistance in maintaining your body position in the current.</p>

<p>A choice that combines Jacuzzi® reliability, quality and value. Spa filters help to remove impurities from the water and ensure your spa pool water is safe for you, your family and friends.

<p>It is recommended that a whirlpool bathtub be cleaned at least twice a month. Swim Spas also act as smaller swimming pools in the sense that you can play around in them, or with some of the split-models, you actually have a hot tub spa in one end of it and a swimming area in the other end. Regularly have a professional check your spa or hot tub and make sure it is in good, safe working condition, and that drain covers are in place and not cracked or missing.</p>
<p>Given its background, the options that Jacuzzi offers elevates bathing from a cleaning session to a bathing experience you'd find in a spa. Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean. The you must consider also that where a hot tub is subject to regular use it will accumulate natural body oils, perspiration, and other material that may mark the water line.</p>
