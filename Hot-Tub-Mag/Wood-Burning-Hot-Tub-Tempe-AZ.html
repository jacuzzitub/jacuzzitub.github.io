The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>
