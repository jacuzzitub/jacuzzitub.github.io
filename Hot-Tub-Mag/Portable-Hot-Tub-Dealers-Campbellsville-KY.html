There are hot tubs suitable for very small spaces and even unusual geometric designs. Swim spas, on the other hand, offer you the two options that you can choose from to suit the weather.

Most common reasons for buying one are for fitness, a pool for the family, relaxation, or year-round swimming capabilities.
