<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>The massage is conducted by placing heated stones on the skin along the spine or on the chakras. Corner bathtubs also have a place in smaller homes and buildings. Spa systems (or air systems) are slightly different to a whirlpool bath in that they don't use water through the jets, but air. This is an Endless Pools Swimming Pool.
