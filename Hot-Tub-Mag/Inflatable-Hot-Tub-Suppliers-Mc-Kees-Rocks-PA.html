<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>In addition, Jacuzzi is also supplied with Filtration system to keep water fresh and sparkling. Along with the great customer satisfaction that we have always strived to provide, now we also offer FREE water testing and filter cleaning by donation - along with FREE site checks for those interested in a new Arctic Spa or swimming pool. I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
