<p>Hot tubs serve their purpose well in reducing stress and muscle tension from our body-from an adult body used to extreme temperatures. The hotel facility includes an indoor swimming pool, a whirlpool , a sauna, massages, a children's playground and free parking. Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference. The trees and fence that you see at the west end start shading the spa from 1.30pm onwards at the spa seat end of the pool which has made it very comfortable during hot summer days.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat.

<p>Four pumps give this piece of equipment a lot of water flow, for therapy and exercise. Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa.
