<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>First this is something that can help you solve a lot of the problems of the day as you take the time to relax in your hot tub at home after a long days drive, or a long day at the office. The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone. For more intensive swimming pool cleaning services, purchase a small, portable pump to remove standing water from the cover.</p>

Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>
