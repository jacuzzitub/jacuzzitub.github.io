<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>When shopping for coverage, be sure that you mention the hot tub to make sure a provider will cover a property with a hot tub. For all swimming pools, insert removable skimmer baskets to catch large debris before entering into the filtration system. When this is done it takes forever for the tub to warm up due to very little amount of power flowing through the heating elements, I do not recommend this way of installation for the large units.</p>

<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
