<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit.

With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>

He considers swim spa workouts an excellent way for seniors to improve their fitness. Run it to the spa and fill with hot water.</p>

Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>
<p>Full range-of-motion swim strokes, stationary leg kicks, banded resistance and rowing, low-impact step training, stretching and heated-water aerobics are all possible with ATV.
