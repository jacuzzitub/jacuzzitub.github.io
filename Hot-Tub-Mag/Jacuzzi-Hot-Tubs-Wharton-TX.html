<p>A Swim Spa is both a swimming pool and a spa or hot tub. Here, we'll learn more about the differences between a hot tub and a Jacuzzi. After you exercise, enjoy a workout cool-down in the comfort of spa seating where hydromassage jets soothe your muscles. Those large oval black things in the photo are the swimming jets. If there is dealer does not know the name of what parts are used in their hot tub or it's a name you have not heard of it best to keep clear of their particular tubs.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>
<h2>Hot Tub Stores Near Me Wharton Texas</h2>
<p>Since a whirl pool is a place where people spend a considerable amount of time inside, it should have good wide panoramic views so as to avoid monotony and boredom. Swim spas offer all the comfort and benefits of hot tubs, but they come in a larger size, almost like a small swimming pool. Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
<p>A choice that combines Jacuzzi® reliability, quality and value. Spa filters help to remove impurities from the water and ensure your spa pool water is safe for you, your family and friends. In addition, swimming against swim jets is a very different experience to swimming against a natural water current. So if your swim spa's shell structure fails anytime within the 10 year warranty, we replace it. No questions asked.</p>
<p>We are a brand built on life's experiences and are designed for 2 different types of customers who have different aquatic needs; The first is the individual or famly who sees aquatic exercise as a essential part of their lifestyle we offer SwimFit Swimspas.” Our second offering is SwimExpert Swimspas” for those who want it all offered in a line of swimspas that help your customer live life to the fullest.</p>

Just relaxing in the hot water relieves stress and fatigue from the mind and body, and after strenuous exercise or work, soaking in these waters eases stiffness and pain of the muscles and joints, helps increase circulation and oxygen flow and has been known to help most circulatory illnesses.</p>
<p>The company's history can be traced back to the mid-20th century when the Jacuzzi brothers invented an underwater pump that could be used to relieve pain in arthritis patients. Endless pool - swim spa promises a laminar current where you can even choose to have rowing equipment or an underwater treadmill to upgrade your normal swimming workouts The water carries most of your weight effortlessly for you to be able to perform any kind of exercises or workouts that you desire.</p>

<p>Because they use a heavy gauge vinyl liner inside the steel wall panels (just like a standard steel wall inground swimming pool), you are not constrained by a mold. PDC Spas has a big selection of swim spas with a variety of options for current power and jet customization. There are dangers to buying used spas, and if the hot tub is not set up and running so you can test the pump, heater, and other features, then you might be very disappointed when you get it home and set up.</p>
<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>
