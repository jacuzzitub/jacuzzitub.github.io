<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC. Other optional features in some varieties of Jacuzzi tubs include a mood light, heater, and even a water-level sensor.

Some also offer dual-temperature control where you can set one side of the swim spa to a comfortable swimming temperature and the other side to a temperature more suited to hydrotherapy.</p>
<h2>Hot Tub Home Cranford New Jersey</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help. This is why most people have their swim spa above ground and consider building steps or a deck around it if they want a more landscaped look. In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa. Lidos, ocean pools, in Australia were created by enclosing a section of the rock shelf where water circulates through the pools or by constant flooding over the side of the pool during high tide.</p>

These little creatures can rapidly grow their colonies, especially in hot tubs that are not well maintained, and those that do not have periodic cleaning of the water.

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>

<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>That can easily occur if you spend more than 10 minutes in a hot tub with a water temperature of 104°F (40°C). The only trick is that you should make sure that you are choosing direct swim spas. When combined with the heat of the water, the dehydrating and blood-thinning effect of the alcohol may cause you to become weak or dizzy.
