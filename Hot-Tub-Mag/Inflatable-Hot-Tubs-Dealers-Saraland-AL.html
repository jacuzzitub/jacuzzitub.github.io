<p>Hot Tubs Rock is a local and independently owned company based in Magor, South Wales. I have quickly become addicted to a rigorous program of aquatic exercise and swimming. If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them. Swim spas can come with either one or two tanks. After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot.

Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications.

<p>The relaxation brought about by a hot tub bath will be quite beneficial if you are suffering from high blood pressure. And swimming is an activity that you can do. Many people like this activity because it offers many benefits. It's tempting as you're cruising the aisles of big box stores to fall for really cheap chlorine that's says for Pools and hot tubs”.

<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
<p>Exercise isn't the only pastime when there's a swim spa at home. With all commercial hot tubs found in hotels, gyms and health clubs they are mandatory to list the full set of safely points next to the hot tubs for all users to read. Among the latest trends on the market swim spas are taking hold; They allow to swim even in small-sized tubs and even to work out in the water and then relax with a hydro therapeutic massage.</p>
