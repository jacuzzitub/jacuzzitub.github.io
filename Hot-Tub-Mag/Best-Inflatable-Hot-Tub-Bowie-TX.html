<p>With regular workouts lasting a reasonable amount of time (no, five minutes is not going to cut it), the body's compensation for the lack of lung capacity underwater will in turn increase capacity on dry land. While typically installed on a patio, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can be installed indoors in a converted garage or with new construction.
