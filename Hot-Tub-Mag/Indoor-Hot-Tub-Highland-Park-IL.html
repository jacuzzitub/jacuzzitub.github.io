<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub.

<p>Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
