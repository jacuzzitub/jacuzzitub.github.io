<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>The innovative bowed sidelines of the Kona , Sport and Splash Series are more comfortable than conventional swim spas, creating a more spacious swim area with greater freedom of movement. An Endless Pools® Fitness System and Swim Spa from the makers of Hot Spring® Spas, truly is a versatile option for the backyard. Ultimately, the warranty that a supplier is prepared to offer on their product is the best judge of the quality of the spa and how long you can expect it to last.</p>
