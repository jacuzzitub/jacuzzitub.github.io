<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs. Michael Phelps Signature Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach Bob Bowman for all types of training, swimming, fitness programs and aquatic therapy.

<h3>What Your Spa Or Hot Tub Is Trying To Tell You Cheswick</h3>
<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use.
