Especially going to people's houses, and working and setting up soft tubs & hot tubs for them. The J-500 Collection Combining innovative technology, ground-breaking design and legendary Jacuzzi® hydromassage, The J-500® Collection establishes a new standard in backyard luxury.

A bathroom size of 2.8 m by 2.8 m is sufficient enough to fit in a Jacuzzi and leave enough space around it.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
