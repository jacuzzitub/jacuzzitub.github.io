This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing.

<h3>Swim Spa Covers Chula Vista</h3>
<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>

PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>
