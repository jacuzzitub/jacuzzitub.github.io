<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. Sometimes, for people who are advanced in age or are very obese or are suffering from severe arthritis, swim spas provide the only available option. An easy to follow Spa & Hot Tub heater Troubleshooting Guide. Swimming pools are a great option, but may be too large for the area in your lawn. Unlike the technology-based saunas that the West uses, the Finnish sauna uses steam generated by throwing water over heated stones within the sauna room.</p>

<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools.

<h3>Swim Spa Prices Belmont</h3>
