<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>

Ensure you have plenty of space to fit the hot tub, as well as easy access to the power source and enough room to safely get in and out of the hot tub. Hydropool has swim spas for relaxing, working out and even a little bit of both. Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>

<p>Hot tubs or spas are typically set to around 40°c - although this can be lowered if you find you find that 40°c is a little too hot for you.

<p>The level of hydrotherapy that a spa can offer is based on the quality and function of the jets. Jacuzzi TargetPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area.

Once you have a sense of the type and size of hot tub that works best for you, it's also worth considering other factors that will make your experience more enjoyable.</p>

Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores.
