<p>Hot Tubs Rock is a local and independently owned company based in Magor, South Wales. I have quickly become addicted to a rigorous program of aquatic exercise and swimming. If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them. Swim spas can come with either one or two tanks. After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot.

Programmable sleep timers - This function gives you the control to turn your spa off completely for the duration of the night, avoiding any sleep disturbances for family or neighbors.</p>

Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
