<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content.

<p>Many public pools require women and men with long hair to wear a swim cap while in the pool. Salt can clog the motor that powers air or water jets on other brands or rust out the pump or heater. Heat pumps provide only great benefits when added to your spa pool or swim spa. Take a look at all the wonderful videos on our video page to get a feel for all the different pools, spas and swim spas on the market today.</p>
<p>These help to make your workout more intensive by offering more resistance in the water, so you are basically swimming the equivalent of a long distance within a relatively small space. At the same time, the price of swimming pools rose greatly as well….partially due to advances in technology and features, and partly due to the increased price of installation and insurance that pool builders had to pay.</p>

<p>In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight.

You can customize most swim spas with steps, an ozone or bromine filtration system, cover or various colors of internal shells and external cabinet.</p>
<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
