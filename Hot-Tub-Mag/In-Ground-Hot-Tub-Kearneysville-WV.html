<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>
<h2>Best Place To Buy A Hot Tub Kearneysville West Virginia</h2>
<p>Among the highest in demand there are hydromassage hot tubs , which play their part in relieving the stress we accumulate every day, leaving a sensation of delight and wellness for the body and the state of mind. H2X works on a super energy-efficient industrial motor and the best part is that it costs 70% lesser than the other swim spas of its category. The Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump is the only spa pool heat pump available that works in tandem with the spas conventional heater.</p>
<p>Whether you are anxious about swimming classes for you or you are afraid for the safety of your children, swim spas offer an opportunity for private swimming classes. This is a feature that allows a Jacuzzi to keep the water in the tub warm. This is not limited to just swimming, but also includes underwater aerobics, aquatic therapy, weight lifting and other water-based exercise routines. PDC's Top Quality Acrylic Spas are set apart from other hot tubs with a full range of exclusive patented features including PDC's Temperlock energy conservation system, Air'sagge warm air therapy, Powerflo filtration, and AdvantagePack equipment flexibility.</p>
<p>Only ThermoSpas offers a FREE, on-site review of your location to answer all your questions and give you personalized, expert advice. It's easy to spot the difference between the swim spas in PDC Spas' three series. We thought of every detail in our design including beautiful, adjustable water features to enhance your spa experience. You can think of a swim spa as being similar to hot tubs in that they are small, self contained tubs.</p>
<h3>Types of Premium Swim Spa Kearneysville</h3>
<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well. These centers usually have more than one pool which caters to guests of different swimming requirements. These bacteria are found naturally in water, and hot tubs that aren't disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Exercise in general will increase the amount of air taken into the lungs, but swimming in particular can make a big impact. I would recommend Spa World (especially their swim spa range) to anyone that is weighing between a spa and a pool. With three airless jets, comfortable seating for the whole family, 27 hydromassage jets, and generous recreation space, harmony between work and play is possible. All Jacuzzi® brand bathtubs are made from the highest quality acrylic.</p>
<p>Finally, if you live in an area, which has hard water, then you will need to add an anti-scaling chemical to stop the build-up of calcium deposits on the sides and floor of your hot tub. The powerful jets enable you to swim in place just as you would in a regular pool or in the lake. Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>
<p>Every Jacuzzi® hot tub has been researched and engineered to deliver advanced hydrotherapy and with patented jet technology a truly unique hot tub experience. All models have exactly the same seating layout and features, the only difference is the number of swim jets in the swim resistance zone and the overall number of pumps. The Master Spa Parts 8' x 18' cover (94" x 215") Master Spas® swim spa replacement cover is a Master Spa Factory OEM replacement part.</p>

<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>It is said that hot tubs helps people by making the blood circulate better. Next to that there are headrests, water fountains, sound systems and thermal covers for a 360° wellness experience. Most swim spas sold in Canada will set you back between $10,000 and $50,000 CAD. Steamy hot tubs can also pose a risk of Legionnaires' disease , a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
