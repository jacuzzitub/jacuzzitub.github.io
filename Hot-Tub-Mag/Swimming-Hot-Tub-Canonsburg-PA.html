<h3>What's The Difference Between A Hot Tub, Jacuzzi And A Spa Canonsburg</h3>

Swim spas have most of the benefits of a swimming pool but can be installed into a smaller space and are much cheaper. Swim spas with a powerful current can give you the same results as working out with weights - a lower current equals less weight or crank up the speed for intense resistance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help.

<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety. The hot-tub cover not only keeps children away from mishaps but also disallows debris, insects, pets and rodents from entering the tub. The Jacuzzi ClearRay water management system simplifies cleaning and maintenance, and the company developed the SmartTub mobile app used to monitor and control many of its hot tubs. Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>
