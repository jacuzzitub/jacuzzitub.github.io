<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs ; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. These days, Jacuzzi employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide and has become the name we most associate with whirlpool baths.</p>
