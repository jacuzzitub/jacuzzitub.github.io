<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>Of course, there also are "public" hot tubs, which are often found at places like gyms or spa resorts. This range features includes: Standard Control Panel, Classic Jets, Classic Foot Massage, 2-Stage Filtration, Multi Coloured Lighting, Comfortable Headrests, Built-in Drink Holders and Classic Waterfall. The Jacuzzi® Hertfordshire showroom is the perfect place to experience the quality & exclusivity of this world famous brand.</p>

<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.
