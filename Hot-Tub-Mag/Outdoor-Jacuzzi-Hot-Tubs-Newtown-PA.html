<p>In 1956 the Jacuzzi brothers invented the original hydrotherapy jet, today with 60 years' experience in hydrotherapy: Jacuzzi® is the brand when you are looking for a hot tub or bathroom products.

Jacuzzi earned the Platinum ADEX Award for their design and innovation of this system, so you can be assured their technology is setting the standard for the hot tub industry.</p>
<p>In most cases, these swim spas cost less an $2.00 a day to operate. If you ever had a chance to relax in a Jacuzzi tub, you must know what it can do to help your mind and body. Of course, the Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. After an active day on the slopes, it is worth relaxing at the hotel's wellness centre with an indoor swimming pool, Jacuzzi and sauna. The warm, small body of water can be a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.</p>

Lucky for you, a swim spa can offer a more controlled environment to help your kids learn the basics of swimming.

<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
