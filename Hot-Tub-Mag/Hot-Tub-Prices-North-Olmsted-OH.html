<p>Many people use the word Jacuzzi to describe a hot tub or spa, but in fact they are incorrect as Jacuzzi is a brand name. Exercise isn't the only pastime when there's a swim spa at home. With all commercial hot tubs found in hotels, gyms and health clubs they are mandatory to list the full set of safely points next to the hot tubs for all users to read. Among the latest trends on the market swim spas are taking hold; They allow to swim even in small-sized tubs and even to work out in the water and then relax with a hydro therapeutic massage.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
