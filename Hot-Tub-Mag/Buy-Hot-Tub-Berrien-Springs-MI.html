<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>

Spa systems (or air systems) are slightly different to a whirlpool bath in that they don't use water through the jets, but air. This is an Endless Pools Swimming Pool.
