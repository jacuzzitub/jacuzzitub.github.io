<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>
