During this time, I continued to watch the growth and increase in popularity of free standing, self-contained swim spas, however, the quality and performance of these spas simply did not meet my standards and expectations. When you come back after the rental time is done, you would empty the water, and take the hot tub away.</p>
<p>However it is also not advisable to spend most of your time swimming. Jacuzzi spas are warranted against water loss due to defects in the spa shell for ten years.

At the same time, water is drawn out, filtered, reheated and cycled back in.</p>
