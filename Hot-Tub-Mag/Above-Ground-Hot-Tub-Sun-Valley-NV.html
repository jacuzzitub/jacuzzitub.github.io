The setup is easy enough on this one, but heating the tub is slow going.</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in.

For girls with long hair, tie their hair up before letting them in. There are air and water jets incorporated in the tub and hair can easily get sucked by the jets.</p>
<p>The Viton seal material is said to be more impervious to chemical wear from chlorine, bromine, ozone and other hot tub water treatments.
