<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi. Designed for ease of use, durability and carefree maintenance, hot tubs deliver a lifetime of pleasure, wherever you are. Each seat is tactically fitted with various types of massage jets in different positions, mounted in a way to massage every part of the body.</p>
<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors.
