<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not about anxiety, it might be that maybe you can't find any good nearby pools or any pools at all. Chlorine and bromine are among the chemicals used to control bacterial growth in hot tub water.

Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>
<p>With the combination of heat and humidity, and water - your body is more than likely losing water while swimming. Lastly, if the Jacuzzi tub does not have a self-cleaning feature, then it will require extra cleaning because even a little bit of water left in the tubing can lead to mold growth and spread of bacteria.

Since hot tubs have been around for years, and the first fiberglass, vacuformed acrylic spas were made in 1982, look for a hot tub dealer that's been in the business for a long time, and you probably can't go wrong.</p>
