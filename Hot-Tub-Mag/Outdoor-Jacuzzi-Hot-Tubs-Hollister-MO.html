<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>The Company offers hot tubs and accessories, such as covers and lifts, synthetic accessories, hot tub complements, and water purification systems. During the 1960's, Roy Jacuzzi took over the business and then started marketing and selling the first Jacuzzi hot tub using the same jet systems that was invented by this family. You may want to consider how many people you will need to accommodate, budget and available space designated for your hot tub.</p>

Most common reasons for buying one are for fitness, a pool for the family, relaxation, or year-round swimming capabilities. Even if you went for the most expensive swim spa that has all the accessories and all the features you desire, purchasing and installing it will still cost you much less than choosing a swimming pool and trying to install it.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
