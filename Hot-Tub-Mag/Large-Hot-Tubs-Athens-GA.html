<p>The level of hydrotherapy that a spa can offer is based on the quality and function of the jets. Jacuzzi TargetPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. If the Jacuzzi bathtub has this feature, run it after each time you use the bathtub.

<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
