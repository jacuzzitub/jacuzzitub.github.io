Many people who suffered from injuries, especially in their legs, that prevented them from walking properly, have chosen to start learning again how to walk in pools. And secondly, by placing the insulation between the spa's pumps and you, you'll enjoy a quieter, more tranquil and restful spa experience.</p>
