They're also great for socializing, since you don't need to run the swimming jets all the time.</p>
<p>If you're considering an online supplier, Google them to see what type of experiences other customers have had and remember that the cost of the swim spa itself will only be part of the overall cost including delivery, concrete base, fencing and certifier and permit fees. Besides the above there are a few other major differences that can be seen between the two, which we will now take a more in-depth look at, and also approach the benefits that a swim spa can bring.</p>

<p>You can still by spas and hot tubs under the Jacuzzi name. For example, a 60-gallon tub would require a 40-gallon water heater.
