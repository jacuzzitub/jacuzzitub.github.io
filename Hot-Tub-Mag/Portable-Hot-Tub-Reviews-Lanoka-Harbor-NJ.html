<p>If you want a bathtub that can double as a place to wash your body, as well as soak and relax, you will want to consider jetted bathtubs, or the more common name, whirlpool tub. Sometimes, for people who are advanced in age or are very obese or are suffering from severe arthritis, swim spas provide the only available option. An easy to follow Spa & Hot Tub heater Troubleshooting Guide. Swimming pools are a great option, but may be too large for the area in your lawn.

<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>

<p>Some of our swim spas have seating along the sides of the spa as well like myLapswim This gives more room for people to sit and enjoy a massage but reduces the pool area at the swim jet end. Most Fantasy hot tubs are plug-n-play for easy installation and operation. Two-in-one swim spa design combines a swim current with hydro massage luxury.

<h3>What Is A Jacuzzi Lanoka Harbor</h3>
<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>In case you need something much bigger, SwimEx makes the 1000 S - a multi-user swim spa that holds 7,700 gallons of water. Besides the usual Jacuzzi jets of water, the entire pool looked like the wake of the QE2. If you are looking for the best quality hot tub for your family, Jacuzzi is the brand for you. In fact, Jacuzzi is a trademarked brand of hot tubs, bath products and pool equipment. Swimming is a well-known way to achieve weight loss, so with the right training regime, a swim spa should definitely be able to help you if you're looking to get slimmer.</p>
<p>If you want both hot and cold water in your spa then a dual zone swim spa is best. I use my hot tub almost every day, sometimes twice a day. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Innovative features include ergonomic seating, hydrotherapy jets, and strong filtration.

<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
