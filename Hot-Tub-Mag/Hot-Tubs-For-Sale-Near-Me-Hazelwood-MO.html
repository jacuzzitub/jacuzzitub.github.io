With Jacuzzi for Life you can experience the luxury of stress-free maintenance and brand new technology every three years for the rest of your life. With swim spas, there are no waterline hook-ups or underground waterlines to deal with either. Sapphire Spas manufacture a high-quality product right here in Australia. Finally, the Jacuzzi Salon Spa is Jacuzzi most advanced and luxurious tub option, combining Jacuzzi's Pure Air and Whirlpool technologies.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming.

<p>Your hot tub will have jets and blowers, which can be switch on or off, depending on how you feel. Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the USA, inspired by the Japanese ofuro Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.</p>

<h3>The Anatomy Of A Hot Tub Pump Hazelwood</h3>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
