<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub. Now, this was fine for a number of years until, of course, spas started springing up in hotels and sports complexes and going to the spa” (yah!) just like the Romans did became cool again.

The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
