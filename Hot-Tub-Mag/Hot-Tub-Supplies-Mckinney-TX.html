<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget. Endless Pools is one of the first companies to develop this Swim Spa, or endless” swimming pool concept quite a number of years ago.</p>
