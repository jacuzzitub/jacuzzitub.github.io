However, some policies exclude coverage for free-standing hot tubs. Science aside, the most important benefit of time in a hot tub is the state of relaxation that's a part of every soak.

Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub.

<p>Now, these hot tub spa reviews do have their limitations. Built-in hot tubs , on the other hand, imply more charges for installation, since they require a pit and a niche for inspection running along the perimeter. The power requirements of these tubs enable the massage jets to function effectively. Some destination spas also offer to plan the stay's itinerary so all you have to do is be there and get pampered.</p>

<p>Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different "bubbly" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices. This process is particularly crucial for spas which are manufactured in extreme weather environments e.g., very hot, very cold or humid conditions.</p>
<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>

It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
