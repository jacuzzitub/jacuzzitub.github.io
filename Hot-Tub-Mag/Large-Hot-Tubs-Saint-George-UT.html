<p>A lot of people ask what is the difference between a swim spa and a swimming pool? Replacement covers and cover lifts are also included in Jacuzzi for Life, just give Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs Ontario a call and make an appointment for your replacement. Arctic Spas® is an original member in good standing as a certified Hottubstar manufacturer. Hard core ab exercises can be achieved by working out against a swim spa current. Jacuzzi is a trademarked brand of hot tubs and other products. We build our swim spas to be used year-round in every possible climate using environmentally friendly Icynene foam insulation.</p>
<p>You even hear stories of people that buy cheap eastern hot tubs and they do not get the cover for the hot tub till months later. Aquatic exercise in a swim spa can be helpful for people with chronic conditions, but Schulte said it varies by person. The Balboa Water Group also offers various parts for the maintenance, upgrading and repair of the hot tub, said parts of which will include hydromassage jets, LED lights for chromatherapy, blowers, heaters and pumps, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
<p>2nd Day Air Shipping not available for chemicals, spas, and other items that normally ship by freight. 1. choose pumps with single speed jet and circulation, 2. Always enquire about the noise of the pump, 3. Don't concern yourself with horsepower ratings, turn your attention to other more valuable components such as the spas jets or filtration systems. Since hot tubs have been around for years, and the first fiberglass, vacuformed acrylic spas were made in 1982, look for a hot tub dealer that's been in the business for a long time, and you probably can't go wrong.</p>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter. Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive.

There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa.

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>

<p>Vortex Spas are the best value, high quality spas available anywhere in the world. According to an article in Skiing Magazine, When you immerse yourself in the hot water of a hot tub, the temperature of your skin and muscles rise, causing blood vessels to dilate and thus increasing blood flow to the skin and muscles. These tubs offer you the same relaxing feeling that a hot tub does. 1. 3 HP Water pump (2 pumps), 2 circulation pumps and 41 jets.</p>

Our Wellness Spas® feature the ability not only to swim in place endlessly against a powerful counter-current, but also to strength-train and even experience a therapeutic hydrotherapy massage.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line.
