The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa.">

<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>
<h2>Best Home Spas Smithtown New York</h2>
<p>The American Bath Factory Champagne Jester Jetted Rolltop is a great example of the functionality of jetted bathtubs. Instead of seating, they have strong water jets that create a current strong enough for you to swim against. Nevertheless, it's a cost that must be considered before purchasing a new whirlpool Jacuzzi tub. Also you should be aware that Modern Hot Tubs have progressed by leaps and bounds in their use of Heat efficient technology.</p>
<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
<p>Enjoy the best of both worlds: a relaxing spa pool and water-based exercise swim spa in the comfort of your backyard. One of the top concerns when dealing with a Jacuzzi bathtub is the growth of bacteria and mold within the jets and tubing. Bring along somebody who already has a Hot Tub or has experience of using a hot tub if you are at all unsure of what you should be looking for when evaluating the possible purchase.</p>
<h3>Residential Pool Or Hot Tub Owners Smithtown</h3>
<p>All of Jacuzzi® hot tubs comply with the California Energy Commission standards of energy efficiency. According to another article by the CDC, you should use pool test strips to check your spa water's pH and free chlorine or free bromine concentration. It seats up to 6 people with a whopping 35 jets including 5 hydro-massage seat jets for maximum luxury. A general rule of thumb is that the water heater should be no less than two-thirds the size of the water capacity of the tub.</p>
<p>Introducing the H2X® premium jetted swim spa, providing an incredible experience all day. This kit has all the chemicals you need to keep the water in your swim spa clear and sanitary, including pH increaser and decreaser, alkalinity increaser and decreaser, calcium booster and a defender chemical to prevent scale build up. The $90 price tag is expensive, but if you perform weekly tests, the chemicals should last for several years.</p>
<p>It has the performance and style synonymous with Jacuzzi®, and is the ideal introduction to the many benefits of hydrotherapy that its classic jets can deliver. You still get jet options to concentrate water sprays to various parts of the body for a soothing water massage. Jacuzzi pump parts and most any type of seals are available online, but be sure to get the right kit for your particular pump type and brand.</p>
<p>For decades, the name Jacuzzi” has been synonymous with any contained body of water which includes water jets to aid relaxation. A Swim Spa is essentially an over-sized spa with an added current. Often times, you will hear a hot tub referred to as a jacuzzi. While there are a few things to learn, with a little training and ongoing advice from a reputable retailer it will take just a few minutes per week to keep your swim spa clean and ready to use at any time.</p>
<h3>Hot Tub Controls Smithtown NY 11787</h3>
<p>The Antigua spa, with a diameter of 2.78 metres, has a groundbreaking octagonal design that adds that extra touch of luxury and distinction, which is so prized in hotels, residential complexes, beauty centres, spas, etc. No matter how you design you Jacuzzi Hot Tub, you are sure the durable finishes will last you many years to come. Others have large pools with a diving board at one end above the water. Easy, the gunk collects on the under side of the spa cover and causes unpleasant odors and will ultimately shorten the life of your cover.</p>
<p>They hold warm water, have seating and include jets that push hot water out from all sides. The Axis Cover System by Master Spas makes swim spa covers for both your H2X and Michael Phelps Swim Spa. Also, hot tubs are pretty easy to maintain, which is what you need if it is going to be something you want to relax in. Especially if you consider it against getting something like a swimming pool which is going to take up a lot of space and be high maintenance.</p>
<p>Instead of purchasing a swimming pool. With Jacuzzi for Life a customer purchases any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub , Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs of Ontario will from then on perform all preventative maintenance with Jacuzzi® Brand products. The size of a swim spa, as well as its therapeutic benefits will greatly improve your fitness routine and help you stay in shape. This range features includes: Illuminated Advanced Control, Speciality PowerPro® BX and FX-L Jets, 4-Stage Filtration, Smart Access Door, Premium LED Lighting, Reversible Backlit Headrests, Illuminated cup holders, Water Rainbow® Waterfall.</p>
