<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home. At almost six metres in length and two and a half metres in width, the AquaSport 19 DTfX acts as a swimming pool, hot tub and aquafit centre all in a single unit. Unfortunately, there are a number of cons that come with having even a small Jacuzzi bathtub installed.</p>
