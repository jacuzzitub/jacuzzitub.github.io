<p>Nothing feels quite so good after a physical workout - or even just after a hard day at the office - than sinking into a nice hot tub(HT) and feeling those jet sprays pulsing against the skin. The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
