<p>Every time summer comes, people start getting restless and try to finds ways to beat the heat. One of the best forms of all round exercise is swimming, an all year exercise that can be enjoyed in the pool, in the sea or in a lake or river. One thing that you do have to consider when choosing the hot tub gazebo, swim spa, or sauna of your dreams is that you have to leave room for getting at the pump and the other components of the hot tub whenever the need arises. For girls with long hair, tie their hair up before letting them in. There are air and water jets incorporated in the tub and hair can easily get sucked by the jets.</p>
<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
