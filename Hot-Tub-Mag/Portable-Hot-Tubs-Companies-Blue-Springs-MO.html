<h3>Swim Spas And Hot Tubs Blue Springs</h3>
<p>It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area.

When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter.
