<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating.

But if you are willing to put up with cheaper construction, a less powerful motor, and higher lifetime heating costs, the difference in purchase price between the two hot tubs might make buying the less expensive one a perfectly reasonable decision.</p>
