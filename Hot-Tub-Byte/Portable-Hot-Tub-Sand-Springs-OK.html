<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>If you're considering an online supplier, Google them to see what type of experiences other customers have had and remember that the cost of the swim spa itself will only be part of the overall cost including delivery, concrete base, fencing and certifier and permit fees. Besides the above there are a few other major differences that can be seen between the two, which we will now take a more in-depth look at, and also approach the benefits that a swim spa can bring.</p>

The swimming pool alternative for any backyard. They can be above ground (like one of our portable spas shown here), they can be sunk into an indoor floor or outdoor deck, or they can even be part of an inground swimming pool (known as a pool and spa combo).</p>

Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>
<p>In most cases, these swim spas cost less an $2.00 a day to operate. If you ever had a chance to relax in a Jacuzzi tub, you must know what it can do to help your mind and body.

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas.
