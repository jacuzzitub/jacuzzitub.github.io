A swim spa is fundamentally a smaller version of a pool and can come in different sizes according to what you want. There have been deaths due to drowning in hot tubs attributed to alcohol use.</p>
<p>If you really love your swim spa or hot tub and want to use it while you are pregnant, you can set the temperature lower, stay in less than 10 minutes, take your temperature, and pay close attention to any feelings of discomfort or sweating. This hot tub has a whopping 120 jets which users say recreates a proper Jacuzzi-style spa in their home. Vinegar can be used as a cleaning agent for hot tubs and is gentle enough that it will not harm any of the working parts or the tub itself.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>
<p>A pool spa is used for people who have plenty of room in their yard and who want the best of both worlds for their swimming and relaxation pleasure.
