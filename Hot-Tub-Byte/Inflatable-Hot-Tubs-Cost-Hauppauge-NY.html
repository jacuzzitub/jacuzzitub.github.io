<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>
<p>The water hot temperature, the massage made by swiveling water jets and the ergonomic shape of the hot tub bring down the body tension and soothe your muscles.

<p>Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different "bubbly" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices. This process is particularly crucial for spas which are manufactured in extreme weather environments e.g., very hot, very cold or humid conditions.</p>
