<p>Many people use the word Jacuzzi to describe a hot tub or spa, but in fact they are incorrect as Jacuzzi is a brand name. Playtime is maximised in a Vortex Swim Spa. We also provide a selection of must-have hot tub accessories to complete your spa experience. Over the course of a year, they found six patients who were allergic to PPMS and who had also used this chemical to treat their hot tubs. This happens because when you are sitting in hot water that is circulating around your body it dilates the blood vessels. When buying a hot tub you need to know how many people you want to invite in.</p>
<p>For example, people with multiple sclerosis should avoid a swim spa because warm water can exacerbate symptoms, while people with arthritis tend to prefer a pool that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

It was basic and even rudimentary, but from that moment on I have been obsessed with swim spas. The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>
<p>Exercise pools are also known as swimming machines, swim systems or swim spas. Jacuzzi® Walk in Tubs are designed, engineered, and assembled right here in America.
