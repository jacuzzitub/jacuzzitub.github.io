The major ways are sexual intercourse, wiping from back to front after urinating, and sometimes from soaking in warm water. Vortex Spas are plumbed using Duraflex flexible PVC plumbing, which is specially designed for use in high performance swim spas.

Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>

In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
