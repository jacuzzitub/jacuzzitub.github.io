<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
