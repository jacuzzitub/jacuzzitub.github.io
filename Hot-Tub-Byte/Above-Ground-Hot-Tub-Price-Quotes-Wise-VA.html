<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Hot tubs and swim spas are both significant investments and both can benefit your physical and mental health as well as your social life. Spa hot tubs are designed in collaboration with physiotherapists in order to enable the final clients to enjoy the advantages of hydromassage. Tom Lachocki, PhD, CEO of the US national Swimming Pool Foundation. If you decide to use a hot tub during pregnancy, take precautions and make sure you soak for a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
<h2>Indoor Hot Tub Wise Virginia</h2>
<p>This wood-fired hot tub is light, easy to handle, to move around and also only takes a 5th of the heating time of conventional hot tubs. Swim spas are only unhealthy if you don't look after them properly. There are so many benefits to owning a swim spa and by following the above seven tips you can be sure to find the best swim spa for your family and needs. One major thing to remember and definitely not overlook is how much space you have to fit your hot tub into.</p>
<p>Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot. The time-tested performance, attractive appearance and obvious quality is apparent to everyone desiring a no-hassle cover lift.</p>
<p>We already know that the tubs can promote better blood circulation. It is also time to start filling the hot tub. We asked PDC Spas for more information and received a call back about seven hours later, which was one of the shortest response times of the companies we reviewed. Portable hot tubs provide the same experience and fun as a standard hot tub. Hot tubs with an ozonator will help sanitize your hot tub, while hot tubs that have a stereo will let you enjoy some relaxing music.</p>
<h3>Swim Spas Are Not Rich Men's Toys Only Wise</h3>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>I have quickly become addicted to a rigorous program of aquatic exercise and swimming. If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them. Swim spas can come with either one or two tanks. After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot. Every aspect of Jacuzzi® hot tubs is designed for energy efficiency, from the proprietary shell construction to the jet pumps and the insulating cover, Jacuzzi save customers money in operating costs year on year.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks and the Romans also all had a great love for communal hot baths fed by natural hot springs and many of these bath houses had massage facilities, sports arenas and places to eat included as well. This GFCI protection panel (Spa Pack) is to be not closer than 5 feet from the hot tub, yet within site of the unit no gates or walls (NEC 680.24 -B2b). Robes, towels, and bottled water are included.Signature tubs have a maximum capacity of 4 people ( no children under 12) Sessions in the Signature Tubs are 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation. The Hydrozone Pro has two powerful swim jets and three pumps, while the Pro Plus has three swim jets and four pumps and the Hydrozone Extreme is the ultimate with four powerful swim jets and five pumps. Three primary actions are important for maintaining the water in your Hot Tub in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
