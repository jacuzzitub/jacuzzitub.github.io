<p>Look for swim spas that are insulated to keep in the heat and pumps and motors that are rated more energy efficient. When you get the hot tubs, the first thing you need to do it to read the installation manual very carefully. Obviously spa pools are wet areas.

<p>Vortex dual layer system keeps the heat from the pumps and plumbing, reduces noise and provides a warm layer between the water and the outside of the spa. The circulation pump, jet pump(s) and electronic control system of all Vortex swim spas are warranted against defects for 2 years. Friends and family can enjoy a pleasant time soaking in the warm water and chatting. You do have to be cautious about the quality of used hot tubs.</p>
