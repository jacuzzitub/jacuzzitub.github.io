<p>A hot tub is a large home made or manufactured tub filled with hot water. The next part would be the swimming pool part. Now here's where it gets a little confusing, so stay with me. Whirlpool Bath is a trade name owned by Jacuzzi for their brand of jetted tubs, as in a Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath for the master bath. Flexible PVC piping is used in all quality spas. He considers swim spa workouts an excellent way for seniors to improve their fitness. Run it to the spa and fill with hot water.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>If you've yet to explore the incredible benefits of swim spas, here's your chance. You may not think of a spa as life-changing, but Clarity Spas aren't just any hot tub. Thus, you can consider swimming at the beach instead of swimming in a swimming pool. 6. Number of jets versus number of pumps-Your average spa water pump should support a maximum of 30 jets.

<h3>Hot Tubs, Spas, Chemicals, Accessories & Service Pleasant Hill</h3>
<p>Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub. Pumps - Various pumps are used perhaps a separate circulation pump depending on the design of the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. To use vinegar to clean a hot tub, simply pour a one gallon jug of white vinegar into the tub and turn on the jets through one cycle.</p>
<p>Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim.

There are often more jets in an air jetted tub than there are in the water jetted tubs. Many people that suffer from such things as arthritis, obesity, physical disabilities, and even learning disabilities, have all been shown to greatly benefit from swimming pool and spa treatments. With technology advancing everyday, the design of the Jacuzzis started developing and now there are about 250 patents in all in the whirlpool bath and spa industry.</p>
<p>Swimming pools used for competitions are usually found indoors and heated to allow usage anytime of the year and to more easily fulfill with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and equipment. Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining.
