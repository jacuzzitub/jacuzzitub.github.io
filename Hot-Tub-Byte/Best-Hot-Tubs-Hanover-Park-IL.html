<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue.

<p>It is best to run the water tests everyday to ensure the purity of the hot-tub water. No swimming pool experience would be complete without room for water toys. All Vortex Swim Spas have topside recesses to place your glasses and bottles.

They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.
