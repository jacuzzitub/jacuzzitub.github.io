<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>

Spa systems (or air systems) are slightly different to a whirlpool bath in that they don't use water through the jets, but air. This is an Endless Pools Swimming Pool. So it is no surprise that some of the best spas in the world are found at hotels and resorts.</p>
<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location. Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>
