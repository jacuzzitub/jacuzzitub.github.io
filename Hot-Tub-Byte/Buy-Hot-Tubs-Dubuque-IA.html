One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>

Forget about the anxiety of public pools, the drive to fancy spas to pamper yourself, or searching for physical therapy centers.

A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in.
