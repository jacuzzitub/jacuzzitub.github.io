<p>A swim spa is ideal for swimming but did you know that it is an ultimate training machine? A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
<p>When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>

<p>Their filtration systems are also made for hot tubs and are not designed to efficiently clean the amount of water found in a swim spa. Swim Spas provide the absolute best swimming exercise work out, using the least amount of space in your home or yard. By incorporating body jets into the sides of the tub, it became the bath that almost single-handedly created an industry. Another thing to remember if you are thinking of buying an indoor hot tub is that, although they are more convenient, indoor hot tubs require more complex installations than traditional outdoor ones.</p>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>Indoor hot tubs offer many conveniences that can't be found with outdoor tubs. If you are able to use a gas heater or heat pump (which offers savings of up to 75%). This bathtub exceeded my expectations. They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>

<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>A system of heaters and jets keep it bubbling, which create satisfying massaging sensation and eventually work as an excellent anecdote to anxiety and stress. Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>

<p>Another cost to consider is the price of hiring someone to professionally install the Jacuzzi bathtub. PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle. In general, hot tubs cost less than swim spas, although very large, beautifully designed models can get pricey. That said, having a high-pressure hydro massage with warm water that is directed to specific body parts can help relieve aches and body pain.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Hot tubs or spas are typically set to around 40°c - although this can be lowered if you find you find that 40°c is a little too hot for you. Sedona Spas fabricates all of our own spa shells in house, this allows us to ensure the utmost quality in production as well as offer our own brand of unique design. The hot tubs on today's market have a pump that circulates the water through pipes and then out of underwater Venturi jets.</p>
<p>Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>
