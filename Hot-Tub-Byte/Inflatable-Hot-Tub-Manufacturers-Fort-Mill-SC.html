If your child is in the pool or hot tub, especially if they are very young, get into the water with them. Swim spas can come with either one or two tanks. After all, whilst pumps and other equipment can be replaced, the swim spas shell cannot. Every aspect of Jacuzzi® hot tubs is designed for energy efficiency, from the proprietary shell construction to the jet pumps and the insulating cover, Jacuzzi save customers money in operating costs year on year.</p>

Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water.
