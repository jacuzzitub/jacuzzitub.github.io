Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs.
