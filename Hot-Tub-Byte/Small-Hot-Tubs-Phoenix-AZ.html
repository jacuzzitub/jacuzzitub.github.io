<p>Hot tubs come in various sizes ranging from the cute, two person "Soft Tub" to the very large multiple person party units. Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>

SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas.

<h3>The Portable Hot Spas And There Benefits Phoenix</h3>
<p>This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
<p>Whether it's a more affordable model you seek or a swim spa with extras - like a built-in LCD TV screen and ice bucket perfect for keeping refreshments cold - we welcome you to come to our showroom and browse our excellent options available in swim spas. The smaller volume of water is less maintenance to keep clean and swimming pools can't typically provide hot water for use throughout the colder months of winter.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
<p>Swim spas are not an ideal choice for families, as only one person can comfortably swim in a swim spa at any time.

<p>It's an inflatable jacuzzi so you can still get a good deal on it, and it holds up to six people and more water than most: up to 290Gal (1097L). Although the swim spa can be used as a fitness platform, there are also a number of other benefits, such as the efficiency and portability that you can get over a full blown swimming pool.

Most swim spas sold in Canada will set you back between $10,000 and $50,000 CAD. Steamy hot tubs can also pose a risk of Legionnaires' disease , a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Wooden hot tubs are still used in some spas and resorts, for the special touch they enhance the interior design with a certain "je ne sai quois" reminding us of long-forgotten times when there were no modern bathrooms and people had to bath in wooden tubs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things.
