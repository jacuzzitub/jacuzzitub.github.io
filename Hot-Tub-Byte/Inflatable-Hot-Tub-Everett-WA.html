<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet.

The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool.

Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
