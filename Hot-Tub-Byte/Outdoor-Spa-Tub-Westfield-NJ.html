<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement.

<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in.

<p>In addition, Jacuzzi is also supplied with Filtration system to keep water fresh and sparkling. Along with the great customer satisfaction that we have always strived to provide, now we also offer FREE water testing and filter cleaning by donation - along with FREE site checks for those interested in a new Arctic Spa or swimming pool. I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
