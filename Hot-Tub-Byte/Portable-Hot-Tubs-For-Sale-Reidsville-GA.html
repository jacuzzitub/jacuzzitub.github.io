<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>We have one of the largest Spa and Hot Tub showrooms in Texas. Deluxe 7-person hot tub with 20 hydrotherapy massage jets. People with hot tub lung may experience flu-like symptoms, including cough, trouble breathing, fever and fatigue. Take a quick tour of million dollar homes and you will notice that many of these spaces include luxurious bathrooms complete with whirlpool tubs. The water resistance in a swim spa can help improve seniors' coordination and confidence and strengthen normal walking patterns in a safe environment.</p>
