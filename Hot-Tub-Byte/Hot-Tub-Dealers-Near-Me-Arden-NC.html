The hotel facility includes an indoor swimming pool, a whirlpool , a sauna, massages, a children's playground and free parking. Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference.

The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
