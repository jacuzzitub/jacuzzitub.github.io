<p>When you own a hot tub or spa you certainly need to make sure you have some protection for it such as one of the quality spa covers that are available. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa. Think about the rules posted at public pools, including no running or diving, showering before and after swimming, and no peeing in the water.</p>

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
