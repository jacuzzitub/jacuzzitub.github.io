<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>

If you decide on a spa pool with a salt-water sanitising system, ensure you understand the details of its functioning and upkeep prior to purchase. Combined with a revolutionary touch screen control with smartphone integration and our finest jetting ever, these hot tubs are as small and powerful as they are beautiful. At Amazon Hot Tubs, we don't post fake sold signs.</p>

Along with the great customer satisfaction that we have always strived to provide, now we also offer FREE water testing and filter cleaning by donation - along with FREE site checks for those interested in a new Arctic Spa or swimming pool. I have to say that this does sound pretty appealing but my suspicion is that they aren't all that comfortable and I would miss the luxury of the moving water and hydrotherapy aspects of the modern hot tub.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace. Now that we know how bad stress can be, let me discuss how the hot tubs affect our stress levels.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not about anxiety, it might be that maybe you can't find any good nearby pools or any pools at all. Chlorine and bromine are among the chemicals used to control bacterial growth in hot tub water. To give you a genuine swimming experience the X-Series delivers stronger resistance and less turbulence than ordinary jetted swim spas. We are the largest manufacturer of hot tubs and hydromassage tubs in Europe, with 30 years of experience.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are usually between 8 to 12 meters long, while swimming spas are usuallybetween 4 to 6 meters. Hot tubs are a great way for families to share in relaxation. Warm water also brings down swelling and loosens tight muscles. Indoor hot tubs come in a variety of shapes and colors to match your bathroom decor. A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>

<p>Not to mention, most swim spas, especially the ones from Hydropool, come fully-equipped with a powerful jetting system. The proper use of hot tub covers will prevent accidental drowning and even some accidents such as an animal leaping into the spa and not being able to get out. Pool chlorine is a calcium based formula; hot tub chlorine is a sodium based formula.

<p>Depending on the level of luxury you're going for you can get hot tubs with different jet speeds, mood lighting and even built in sound systems so you can really make the most of your outdoor space. This acrylic bathtub is extensively used at homes, hotels and many other places. On average, a Jacuzzi tub weighs 700 Lbs, and once you add water and your body weight into the equation, the entire setup can weigh up to 1,000 Lbs.</p>
<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
