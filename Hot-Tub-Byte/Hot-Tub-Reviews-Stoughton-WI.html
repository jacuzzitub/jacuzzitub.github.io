<p>There are different types of swimming pools and they are named based on their usage. Whether it's a more affordable model you seek or a swim spa with extras - like a built-in LCD TV screen and ice bucket perfect for keeping refreshments cold - we welcome you to come to our showroom and browse our excellent options available in swim spas. The smaller volume of water is less maintenance to keep clean and swimming pools can't typically provide hot water for use throughout the colder months of winter.</p>
<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>

<p>You are probably thinking, Yeah, this sounds great, but it probably costs like a trillion dollars.” That is a common misconception about Swim Spas…that they are only for the fabulously wealthy. Illumatherapy also offers four points of entry, with two on each side of the tub, and air bubbles spraying from the jets give the appearance of dancing as they reflect the light. The blowers make the hot tub feel like you've got your own personal geyser - forcing air from the bottom of the pool, and creating a very relaxing environment for you.</p>
