<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks. And because swim spas are usually larger than normal spa pools you have more room for relaxing or more room for family and friends. They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>The first way that we can prevent dehydration while swimming is to ensure that proper amounts of water are being consumed. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tub is built using state-of-the-art machinery, taking pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. An advantage of having a small hot tub is that it makes it a lot easier to get it into gardens as many small tubs are designed to be fit through a standard door therefore there is no expense for a crane to get the tub into the garden and it makes it easier to carry the tub into your garden.</p>

<p>In 1970, Jacuzzi added heating and filtration systems to its tubs in order to keep them clean and warm. Jacuzzi's Espree collection features curves specifically designed to contour around the body's natural curves. There's small hot tubs are ideal for people that wish to have a hot tub, but do not want a huge hot tub due to them not having room in the garden or just feel they do not have the need for a larger hot tub, as only every 2 people will be using the hot tub.</p>
<p>The Antigua spa, with a diameter of 2.78 metres, has a groundbreaking octagonal design that adds that extra touch of luxury and distinction, which is so prized in hotels, residential complexes, beauty centres, spas, etc. No matter how you design you Jacuzzi Hot Tub, you are sure the durable finishes will last you many years to come. Others have large pools with a diving board at one end above the water. Easy, the gunk collects on the under side of the spa cover and causes unpleasant odors and will ultimately shorten the life of your cover.</p>
<p>In this part of your swim spa, internal turbines create a current you can swim against, just as you would if you swam in the ocean tide; this gives you the optimal exercise of swimming as a form of strength training in a small, efficient area. Owning a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub allows you to take advantage of a water-based therapeutic technique known as hydrotherapy. These lightweight and robustly constructed tubs are provided with air switch, hand shower, golf waterfall and dream pillow.</p>

This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!).

<p>A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>

<p>Multiple conditioning grills smooth and redirect the water, resulting in a swim current that is free of turbulence. Jacuzzi designed the CLEARRAY water purification system, which uses an exclusive ultraviolet light filter to remove bacteria from your spa water.

<p>Some of our swim spas have seating along the sides of the spa as well like myLapswim This gives more room for people to sit and enjoy a massage but reduces the pool area at the swim jet end.

Aqua Spas offers both the Michael Phelps and H2X series from Master Spas, giving you top-of-the-line swim spas to choose from.</p>
<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation.

Three primary actions are important for maintaining the water in your Hot Tub in tip-top shape.</p>
<p>The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body. Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>
