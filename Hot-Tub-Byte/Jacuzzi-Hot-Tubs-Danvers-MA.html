<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>

<p>The level of hydrotherapy that a spa can offer is based on the quality and function of the jets. Jacuzzi TargetPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. If the Jacuzzi bathtub has this feature, run it after each time you use the bathtub. Once you have a sense of the type and size of hot tub that works best for you, it's also worth considering other factors that will make your experience more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Hot tubs or spas are typically set to around 40°c - although this can be lowered if you find you find that 40°c is a little too hot for you. Sedona Spas fabricates all of our own spa shells in house, this allows us to ensure the utmost quality in production as well as offer our own brand of unique design. The hot tubs on today's market have a pump that circulates the water through pipes and then out of underwater Venturi jets.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool.

In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
