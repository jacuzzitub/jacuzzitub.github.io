<p>There are different types of swimming pools and they are named based on their usage. Whether it's a more affordable model you seek or a swim spa with extras - like a built-in LCD TV screen and ice bucket perfect for keeping refreshments cold - we welcome you to come to our showroom and browse our excellent options available in swim spas. The smaller volume of water is less maintenance to keep clean and swimming pools can't typically provide hot water for use throughout the colder months of winter.</p>
<p>The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>

They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.
