<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>

This is why most people have their swim spa above ground and consider building steps or a deck around it if they want a more landscaped look. In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa. Lidos, ocean pools, in Australia were created by enclosing a section of the rock shelf where water circulates through the pools or by constant flooding over the side of the pool during high tide.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore. Because of this, all spas that use an ozone system should also include a mixing chamber that ensures ozone receives the correct contact time with the water.

<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment. Hot tubs are also found at natural hot springs ; in this case, the water may be dangerously hot and must be combined with cool water for a safe soaking temperature. These days, Jacuzzi employs nearly 5,000 people worldwide and has become the name we most associate with whirlpool baths.</p>
<p>The three different kinds of containers used for hot tubs are wooden barrels, fibreglass whirlpools, or large bathtubs.
