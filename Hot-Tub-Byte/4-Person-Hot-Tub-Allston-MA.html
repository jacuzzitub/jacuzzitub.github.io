<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>It has the performance and style synonymous with Jacuzzi®, and is the ideal introduction to the many benefits of hydrotherapy that its classic jets can deliver. You still get jet options to concentrate water sprays to various parts of the body for a soothing water massage. Jacuzzi pump parts and most any type of seals are available online, but be sure to get the right kit for your particular pump type and brand.</p>

<p>So these many jets (not that many really) simply do not have enough power to actually make these Jets perform properly, So for performance in a Hot Tub it is just not a simple question of the number of Jets but it does come down to things like engineering and design and the balance of the Jets with the correct motors and water pumps to produce the better all round product More often than not, these Hot Tubs with lower rated motors have to have a diverter valve fitted so that other parts of the spa can be turned off to get any decent power where one is actually sitting.</p>
<p>Their parts are also generally cheaper to ship and arrive sooner, reducing downtime if there is a problem with the swim spa in the future. Whilst it is possible to produce the spa's jets and other plastic components using a quantity of reused plastics, it is difficult to guarantee their fundamental quality. One of the most popular additional features that people add onto their Jacuzzi bathtubs is an independent heater.</p>

<p>It is best to run the water tests everyday to ensure the purity of the hot-tub water. No swimming pool experience would be complete without room for water toys.

Remember that swim spas are mechanical products and like a car you'll need replacement parts from time to time.</p>

Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose. Both styles offer heat seam pillows that prevent heat loss through the seams of your spa and upgraded rubber grip handles.</p>
