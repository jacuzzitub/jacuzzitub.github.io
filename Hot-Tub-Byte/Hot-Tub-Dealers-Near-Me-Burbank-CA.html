<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>

The reason is air capacity is cut by approximately 75% during water exercise because of the water's pressure on your body.</p>

Although the swim spa can be used as a fitness platform, there are also a number of other benefits, such as the efficiency and portability that you can get over a full blown swimming pool. Each hot tub is master crafted to achieve enhanced, innovative therapy and high tech advancements in construction, performance, insulation, filtration and heating systems.</p>
