<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area. While there are many similarities between an exercise spa, lap pool and swim spa, securing a great deal comes from understanding exactly what you are looking for and why. We provide this Jacuzzi bathtub on several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers.</p>
