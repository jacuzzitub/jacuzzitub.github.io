<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa. This is not very critical in the maintenance of your Hot Tub but of course, a pleasing visual appeal of clear water will considerably add to the experience. Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>
