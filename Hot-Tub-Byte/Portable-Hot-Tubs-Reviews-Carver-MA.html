<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard. Enjoy the benefits of aquatic fitness in the comfort and privacy of your home, with a variety of low-impact activities to keep your body limber and feeling good.</p>

Jacuzzi developed the first hot tub pump 60 years ago and continues to provide innovative hydrotherapy products and features. For the ultimate in relaxation, a whirlpool bath is absolutely ideal for easing muscle tension & improving blood circulation, and now it's even easier to upgrade than ever. Be sure when ordering an Aqua Flow Viton seal kit that it will match the pump used in your Cal Spa, Marquis, Clearwater, Coleman or other spa brand that from time to time has used Aqua Flo pumps in their spas.</p>
<p>Whether you are anxious about swimming classes for you or you are afraid for the safety of your children, swim spas offer an opportunity for private swimming classes. This is a feature that allows a Jacuzzi to keep the water in the tub warm. This is not limited to just swimming, but also includes underwater aerobics, aquatic therapy, weight lifting and other water-based exercise routines.

Jacuzzi doesn't mention warranties for their walk-in tubs specifically on their website, but for reference, their whirlpool tubs come with a limited lifetime warranty. Swim spas as typically smaller than lap pools, but offer varied jet speeds and intensity for a customized swim workout that changes as skills improve.</p>

The Ergo Group deals with the finest quality outdoor and luxury products and is proud to partner with Jacuzzi® through Hydrolife. Likewise, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect luxury item that will help you increase the overall value of your home. The plumbing system of all Vortex swim spas is warranted against leaking for 5 years.

One of the most popular additional features that people add onto their Jacuzzi bathtubs is an independent heater.</p>
<p>Aside from the consideration of a spa's heat pump, the insulation within a spa pool determines how much output energy is required to maintain it. There are three main insulation systems used today, it is dependable on the company, manufacturer and model as to which one is adopted.
