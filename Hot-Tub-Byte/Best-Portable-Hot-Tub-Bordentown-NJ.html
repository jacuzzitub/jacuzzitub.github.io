<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>Affordable to buy and to operate, J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are available in several different sizes and configurations. Before you buy a hot tub for your backyard or step into those warm waters at the spa or gym, make sure you know a bit about their safety. Many of our showrooms have a swim spas on the floor that you can sit in to get an idea of the size but if you let us know in advance we can fill one up with water to try out the jets as well.</p>

<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are usually between 8 to 12 meters long, while swimming spas are usuallybetween 4 to 6 meters. Hot tubs are a great way for families to share in relaxation. Warm water also brings down swelling and loosens tight muscles. Indoor hot tubs come in a variety of shapes and colors to match your bathroom decor. A swim spa is an oversized spa pool that has been cleverly designed to allow you to swim, jog and work out using the power of jets to keep your motion stationery.</p>
