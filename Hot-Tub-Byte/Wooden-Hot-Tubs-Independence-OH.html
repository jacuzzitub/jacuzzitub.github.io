<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>

<p>The latest hot tubs have superior ozone systems resulting in the use of much less chemicals. This open-concept tank is large enough to offer many of the benefits that swimming pools do.
