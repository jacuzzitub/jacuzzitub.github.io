<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
<p>Endless Pools' swim spas range in size from 1,200 gallons up to 2,395 gallons. Professional swim spa that uses bigger pumps, more power and specialised swim jets to create a smoother type of water flow and the ultimate swim experience. The Exerswim Propulsion System is what makes the difference between the H2X and the other swim spas. If you choose a pool with a powerful water current, you can easily swim, exercise, get a full body workout, rehabilitate, relax, and still have plenty of fun.</p>
