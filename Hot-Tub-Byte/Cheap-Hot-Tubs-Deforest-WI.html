<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC. Other optional features in some varieties of Jacuzzi tubs include a mood light, heater, and even a water-level sensor. Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose. Both styles offer heat seam pillows that prevent heat loss through the seams of your spa and upgraded rubber grip handles.</p>
<p>Swim spas are similar to a swimming pool in terms of water maintenance but the lower volume of water and the cover on top of the spa means less chemical use. Whether you're a fitness guru with years of training behind you, or new to the world of aquatic exercise, swim spas with adjustable current make it easier than ever to swim laps, exercise or play at the perfect pace.

<h3>Why Do We Call A Whirlpool Bath A "Jacuzzi" Deforest</h3>

Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
