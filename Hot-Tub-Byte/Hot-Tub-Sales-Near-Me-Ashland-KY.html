<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>Buying a used spa is another way of acquiring a hot tub without paying full price. If the swim spas are not cleaned or maintained from time to time, you will not enjoy the swimming experience due to the dirt collected and the bad odor emitted from the swim spa. One of the most overlooked areas in an all season pool is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage. These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
<p>Clearwater Spas Filtration System cleans the entire body of water. 806 winter hot tubs stock photos, vectors, and illustrations are available royalty-free. The design features five jets - three on top for resistance and two underneath for lift - that create a smooth, air-free current for superior low-impact, total-body exercise. Look for a swim spa that insulates both the water in the swim spa and the outer cabinet.</p>
<p>Indoor hot tubs offer many conveniences that can't be found with outdoor tubs. If you are able to use a gas heater or heat pump (which offers savings of up to 75%). This bathtub exceeded my expectations. They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>

<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage. Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>
<p>The therapy depends on the movement of water for a massage, buoyancy and the laminar current for relaxing your muscles, and the right temperature to offer a wholesome experience. Jacuzzi tubs can also be extremely noisy when in use. In fact, the only tool you will need to install your very own swimming pool is a screwdriver.
