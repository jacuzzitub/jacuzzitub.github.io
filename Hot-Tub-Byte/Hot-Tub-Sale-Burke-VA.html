<p>A hot tub is a large home made or manufactured tub filled with hot water. The next part would be the swimming pool part. Now here's where it gets a little confusing, so stay with me. Whirlpool Bath is a trade name owned by Jacuzzi for their brand of jetted tubs, as in a Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath for the master bath. Flexible PVC piping is used in all quality spas. He considers swim spa workouts an excellent way for seniors to improve their fitness. Run it to the spa and fill with hot water.</p>
<p>Great for aching muscles or a sore back, the calming heat of a spa combined with jets for massage is the cure to any bad week. The ALL NEW Premium swim spa line was created to improve the quality of life for you and your family. Perimeter lighting with 15-20 single LED's around the water line of the spa or swim spa. Here we take a look at the swim spa in detail, and answer all your questions so you can make an informed decision about the best pool type for you.</p>

<p>And some hot tubs have too high a level of chemicals. Buoyancy-simulating Levitator Jets are angled upwards toward the swimmer to replicate the natural buoyancy that would be present as you swim in open water. The wooden tub looks a bit like an oversized wine barrel and needs a permanent platform to stand on. The wooden spa is heated by fire, is better outside and needs a fair bit of maintenance to keep it in good working order.</p>
<p>With some minor reconstruction of the bathroom design, even older homes can take advantage of this concept bathtub to open up the room and give a more meditative soak. Infrared home saunas, however, create a sauna environment within a wooden box or even an open space while the heaters create the actual heating effect. With the current's five speeds, the whole family can meet their wellness goals with rowing, resistance exercise, swimming, and relaxing hydrotherapy.</p>
<p>The whirlpool bath was invented in the early 1940s by Candidi Jacuzzi, a second generation Jacuzzi. It's like a hot tub - but with even more benefits. Lay-Z-Spa makes a third entry onto our list with the Monaco hot tub. These little creatures can rapidly grow their colonies, especially in hot tubs that are not well maintained, and those that do not have periodic cleaning of the water. At Master Spas, we make buying a swim spa just as relaxing as owning one.</p>

<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa allows you to exercise, relax, and entertain in the convenience and privacy of your backyard, year-round.</p>
<p>The Vortex control system will adapt and tune itself to the thermal properties of your spa pool and its environment, day to day, season to season, this will reduce 'on-demand heating'. As a fun way to unwind and relieve stress, hot tubs and home spas allow family members to have fun conversation while relaxing together. Sensing the American consumers interest in health, fitness and leisure activities, Roy invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath in 1968.</p>
<p>As a different alternative to an above ground swim spa, you could consider a Little Pool These are smaller versions of full-sized fibreglass swimming pools, made to the same high standards, but they are portable, easy to install, and instant to use. Jacuzzi still to this day continues to innovate & lead the hot tub industry forward. One of the most overlooked areas in a swimspa is the ability of the unit to provide benefits outside the swim and massage.</p>
<p>A spa provides the powerful combination of massage and hot water. Fully programmable using the control panel, the jets allow you to set your endless pool for your fitness and strength. There are three main types of pumps to be aware of when deciding on a spa pool. Multiple hot tub users may shade off innumerable bacteria into the water unknowingly. You can feel the stress melt away as you relax in this hot tub featuring a full lounge seat and 24 targeted jets.</p>

<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
<p>The 150mm swim jets create a current strong enough to swim against. If you want a little more versatility from your hot tub then swim spas are also a popular choice for gardens. Hot tubs are also designed for more than one person, so soaking can be a great opportunity to spend some time with your partner or friends. Vortex Swim Spas are the perfect centre point of any party. The most common type of tub is the Jacuzzi drop in tub For installation, these tubs are simply lowered into a framed enclosure, and they also include Jacuzzi's largest variety of available sizes and shapes.</p>
<p>Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
