<p>A swim spa is ideal for swimming but did you know that it is an ultimate training machine? A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>
<p>In a world where stress accumulates easily on us all, an Arctic Spa hot tub is a respite from the storm. Some people use the internet to make their choice and then they go physically to the dealer and buy the tubs. The best way to experience Jacuzzi is installing it in the homes to have wonderful memories of soaking afresh anytime you want. Getting a Jacuzzi tub installation done allows homeowners to enjoy all the benefits of an outdoor hot tub indoors.</p>

These are super-strong fibreglass pools with ceramic cores, manufactured to the very highest standards using the latest in swimming pool technology.</p>
