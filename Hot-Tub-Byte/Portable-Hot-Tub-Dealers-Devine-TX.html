<p>Hydrotherapy and Jacuzzi hot tubs seem to go hand and hand these days. The company's history can be traced back to the mid-20th century when the Jacuzzi brothers invented an underwater pump that could be used to relieve pain in arthritis patients. Endless pool - swim spa promises a laminar current where you can even choose to have rowing equipment or an underwater treadmill to upgrade your normal swimming workouts The water carries most of your weight effortlessly for you to be able to perform any kind of exercises or workouts that you desire.</p>

Another great characteristic that comes with owning a swim spa is that its maintenance is so much easier then it would be with owning a swimming pool.</p>

Most swim spas found in Canada fall into the mid-range category; costing between $20,000-$35,000. Your swim spa will be the perfect outlet for relaxation, leisure, fun with family. The temperature in an unheated walk-in tub drops to 98.6 in 10 minutes, requiring the bather to add more hot water to remain comfortable.</p>
