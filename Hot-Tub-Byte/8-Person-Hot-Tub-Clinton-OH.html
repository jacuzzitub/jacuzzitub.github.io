Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub.

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa.

The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
