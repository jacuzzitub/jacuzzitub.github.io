<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content. Visit Paradise Spas & Outdoor Living, we serve the Greater Austin area, including Cedar Park Texas, and are excited to offer these unique products.</p>

However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>

If you're not working with a professional swimming pool cleaning services company, consult your owner's manuals for help with start-up procedures. Water maintenance is imperative when using hot tubs. If you find you still need to get to the workings of the hot tub, you can try building a wooden panel to cover that side, and making a number of wooden planters to put nearby as well, to help blend the whole thing in together.</p>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Made with high tech rolling technology, this energy efficient cover is extremely easy to operate and it makes taking on and off your swim spa cover easier than ever. Natural swimming pools attempt to duplicate the environment of natural swimmable lakes which are healthy, non-polluted and ecologically-balanced bodies of water.
