<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>When you install your hot tub or pool you may or may not have used conduit or a duct that is buried in your garden for protecting the cables, if there is spare capacity, you can feed your power and cable leads through the duct to the location normally on a wall near the pool or hot tub. While some spas still use wooden tubs, there are many private spas that use specially designed hot tubs and whirlpools to create a relaxing atmosphere for their clients while still using the healing power of warm water.</p>

Hot tubs are usually heated using an electric or natural gas heater, though there are also submersible wood fire hot tub heaters, as well as solar hot water systems. This includes a self-cleaning option and an independent heater so your water heater does not take such a beating every time it tries to fill up the tub.</p>
<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location.

Certain chemicals, such as chlorine and bromine, can kill germs in swim spas, pools and hot tubs as long as proper pH and disinfectant levels are maintained.</p>
<p>My experience with the Jacuzzi company has been most unpleasant, If you should purchase one of their very expensive walk-in tubs and it needs repair at some point, be prepared to fix it yourself as the company has forgotten you name after the sale is made. In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
