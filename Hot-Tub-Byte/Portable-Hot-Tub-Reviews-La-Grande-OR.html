<p>Hot tub pumps are critical for any spa. As water flows through the pipes and plumbing towards the jets it can draw in air so as to make a water air mixture by an action which is known as venturi. Designed for ease of use, durability and carefree maintenance, hot tubs deliver a lifetime of pleasure, wherever you are. Each seat is tactically fitted with various types of massage jets in different positions, mounted in a way to massage every part of the body.</p>
<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>
