<p>There are various kinds of spas you can indulge in as per your requirements and convenience. For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property. If your swim spa is not insulated or if you have lower-powered pumps, you might end up wasting money on high water and electric bills. The average swim spa weighs 3,000 pounds before adding a drop of water, and measures roughly 52 inches high.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa. Have a look at our massive range of spa pools and contact us or your local spa shop to sit in some to see how they fit.</p>

<p>If you're looking to make an investment that will provide you with many years of enjoyment, a Hydropool Swim Spa might just be for you. In the following paragraphs we will detail the three most common automatic water sanitization units found in spas and swim spas today. Swim spas are cost efficient. Also, the water in a hot tub is not changed with each use, but is kept sanitary using methods similar to those used for swimming pool sanitation citation needed Another difference between baths and hot tubs is that soaps and shampoos are not used in wet-jetted hot tubs (although they can be used in air-jetted hot tubs).</p>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>The hot water massage stimulates the body and encourages it produce stress-relieving endorphins. Levitator Jets mimic this additional force by helping to push your body upwards, providing you with a more natural way to swim in place. Our AquaFlow Swim Jet Design provides a wider, deeper, smoother current and our tank design has no hidden obstacles like steps or benches for your feet to hit in the swim lane - giving you a far superior swimming experience than any other swim spa available today.</p>

<p>If the hot tub freezes or is damaged due to maintenance issues, count on any claim you put in being denied regardless of how your specific policy handles hot tubs. The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo.

Sensing the American consumers interest in health, fitness and leisure activities, Roy invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully integrated whirlpool bath in 1968.</p>
<p>Finally, if you live in an area, which has hard water, then you will need to add an anti-scaling chemical to stop the build-up of calcium deposits on the sides and floor of your hot tub. The powerful jets enable you to swim in place just as you would in a regular pool or in the lake. Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>
