<p>We all know that spas and hot tubs have been around for numerous amounts of years, this being said the old economical spas always had there setbacks. A massage, body treatment, or esthetics treatment is the perfect addition to your time in our world famous natural hot mineral water. Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect. All swim spas, hot tubs , and Jacuzzis contain jets to mix air with pressurized water to provide a massage experience. Perspiration caused due to a sauna bath helps in opening up skin pores and expulsion of body toxins and impurities.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>Hot tubs are a wonderful excuse for getting out in the garden more often, and with care they can be designed to blend into their surroundings so they don't stick out as an eyesore. Because of this, all spas that use an ozone system should also include a mixing chamber that ensures ozone receives the correct contact time with the water. Eco Spas offers a line of spas that are compact, reasonably priced with an extremely durable shell and cover.</p>
<p>With regular workouts lasting a reasonable amount of time (no, five minutes is not going to cut it), the body's compensation for the lack of lung capacity underwater will in turn increase capacity on dry land.

<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>

This is even more important if you don't plan on using the bathtub again for several days. An electric heater can also be installed for enjoying hot whirling water in Jacuzzi.
