It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in.

This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
<h2>Backyard Hot Tub Boone Iowa</h2>
<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>

With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps. Take a look at the photos below, which demonstrate the various types of Swim Spas in different environments.</p>

Through it's sterilizing effect, Vortex's Purezone Spa Pool UV steriliser will not only make your spa safe for you and your family, but also reduce your use of chemical sanitisers.

<p>After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body.

By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>

With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>
<p>3. Programmable circulation pumps-This system is larger and has the option to be time programmed on how long you want it to run for, dependable on how often your spa is being used meaning they are energy efficient.

The reason for this is because this elongated part is the swimming pool part. If your Jacuzzi bathtub comes with a built-in filtration and water purification system, maintaining your hot tub should be a breeze. A 2000 study of risk factors for urinary tract infections among young women found no difference in use of hot tubs between those who had recurrent UTIs and those who did not.</p>
<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current.
