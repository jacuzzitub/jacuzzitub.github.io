<p>You will find that there are many manufacturers of bath tubs on the market today but only one name really stands above the rest. We'll describe the average swim spa and compare that with both of the largest Hydropool models in the article below. Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa. Many times, people who choose swim spas are looking to avoid paying more for a swimming pool. Hot tubs refer to large tubs of hot water in which the person bathing is submerged.</p>
<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa. This is not very critical in the maintenance of your Hot Tub but of course, a pleasing visual appeal of clear water will considerably add to the experience. Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>

<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current.
