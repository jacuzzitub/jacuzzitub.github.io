<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
<p>Quality tubs start at about $1,500, but depending on the added amenities, prices can climb as high as $5,000 or $6,000. Jacuzzi's Whisper technology features a patented pump mount system that absorbs half of the vibrations and cuts the tub's heating and pump systems sounds in half. You can spend some time with your loved ones in this stress-free environment where you can relax together and catch up. Trying to swim spas with your close family members or friends could be fun and a new experience that will help you get closer to each other.</p>

By producing a continuous current, swim spa water pressure encourages continuous swimming motion, producing a more effective exercise regimen.</p>
