The jet system commonly installed in a whirlpool tub, hot tub, or outdoor spa provides a massaging motion that targets the muscle groups in the body.

Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>

SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas.

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>

<p>One of the best forms of all round exercise is swimming, an all year exercise that can be enjoyed in the pool, in the sea or in a lake or river. One thing that you do have to consider when choosing the hot tub gazebo, swim spa, or sauna of your dreams is that you have to leave room for getting at the pump and the other components of the hot tub whenever the need arises. For girls with long hair, tie their hair up before letting them in. There are air and water jets incorporated in the tub and hair can easily get sucked by the jets.</p>

Jacuzzi keeps things simple by only offering two walk-in tub lines: the Jacuzzi Walk-In Tub and the Finestra Bathtub.</p>
<p>This area generally doesn't hold more than one or two people at a time, and its jets mimic those found in traditional hot tubs.
