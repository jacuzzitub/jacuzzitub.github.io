<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>

Hot tubs and saunas are a great way to relax after a long day and both have been proven to provide several health benefits. Some Swim Spa units have just one body of water. This involves a considerable amount of extra work, however, as the ground in your backyard will have to be excavated before the installation can take place, just like it would with a regular inground swimming pool.</p>
