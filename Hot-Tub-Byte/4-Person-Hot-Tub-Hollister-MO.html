<p>My experience with the Jacuzzi company has been most unpleasant, If you should purchase one of their very expensive walk-in tubs and it needs repair at some point, be prepared to fix it yourself as the company has forgotten you name after the sale is made. In addition, some manufacturers offer pools with an easy-to-clean Gelcoat surface that helps minimize algae build up and creates a barrier against moisture absorption.</p>
<p>Hot tub covers should always be on the Jacuzzi when not in use, keeping excess dirt and dust out of the water and jets, keep wandering children out of the water (many are lockable) and reducing heat loss to keep your bills as low as possible. Texas Hot Tub Company is the top choice to find quality Jacuzzi Spas in the DFW area.
