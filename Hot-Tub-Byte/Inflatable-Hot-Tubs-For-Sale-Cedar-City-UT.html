<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC. Other optional features in some varieties of Jacuzzi tubs include a mood light, heater, and even a water-level sensor. Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose. Both styles offer heat seam pillows that prevent heat loss through the seams of your spa and upgraded rubber grip handles.</p>
<p>You can use a smartphone app to run your swim spa from afar, opt for a speaker system and even a fancy cover to protect your investment.

These are common pressure areas and jetted bathtubs know how to attack what ails you.</p>
