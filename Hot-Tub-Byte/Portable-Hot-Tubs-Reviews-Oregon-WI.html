We'll describe the average swim spa and compare that with both of the largest Hydropool models in the article below. Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa. Many times, people who choose swim spas are looking to avoid paying more for a swimming pool. Hot tubs refer to large tubs of hot water in which the person bathing is submerged.</p>
