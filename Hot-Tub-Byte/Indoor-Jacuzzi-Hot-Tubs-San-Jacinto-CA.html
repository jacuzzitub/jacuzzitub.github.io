<p>If you are unfamiliar with a swim spa, then just the title is enough to make you wonder what it is and how it can benefit you. For those who really need exercise and can't just go for a run, a swim spa may be the answer. Spa Tacular Hot Tubs first opened its doors for business in 1999. Our Team always strives to find innovative solutions to make the hot tub experience easy, fun and unforgettable for our customers.

<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa. This is not very critical in the maintenance of your Hot Tub but of course, a pleasing visual appeal of clear water will considerably add to the experience. Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>

From jet placement to optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a JACUZZI® Hot Tub is a showcase in quality design. They soon created a tub with a built-in jet whirlpool, which took off in popularity.</p>

This is great for people who want to have hot tubs indoors but could not get a big tub to fit inside.

<p>With a Balboa hot tub, life is simpler and happier - just the warm water and you communing to drive the stress away from your mind and eliminate the toxins from your body. Our most compact swim spa, the X200 combines our new jetted swim current with the mental and physical health benefits of hydromassage.
