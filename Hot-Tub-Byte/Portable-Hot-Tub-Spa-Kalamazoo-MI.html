<p>Every time summer comes, people start getting restless and try to finds ways to beat the heat. The major ways are sexual intercourse, wiping from back to front after urinating, and sometimes from soaking in warm water. Vortex Spas are plumbed using Duraflex flexible PVC plumbing, which is specially designed for use in high performance swim spas. A swim spa is fundamentally a smaller version of a pool and can come in different sizes according to what you want. There have been deaths due to drowning in hot tubs attributed to alcohol use.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in. However, like a spa, it is equipped with spa jets, so you can enjoy the benefits of relaxation and pain relief that hydrotherapy offers. This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>

<p>A soak in the hot tub is also helpful for stimulating healthy blood flow and stress relief. Sitting in a hot tub spa with the water temperature no higher than 104 degrees helps relax your body. Most cases are tied to indoor hot tubs, where there is less ventilation. An advantage of swim spas over a traditional swimming pool is its ability to be used year round.

<p>The Antigua spa, with a diameter of 2.78 metres, has a groundbreaking octagonal design that adds that extra touch of luxury and distinction, which is so prized in hotels, residential complexes, beauty centres, spas, etc. No matter how you design you Jacuzzi Hot Tub, you are sure the durable finishes will last you many years to come. Others have large pools with a diving board at one end above the water. Easy, the gunk collects on the under side of the spa cover and causes unpleasant odors and will ultimately shorten the life of your cover.</p>
<p>Hot tubs or spas are typically set to around 40°c - although this can be lowered if you find you find that 40°c is a little too hot for you.

Many customers are choosing a Vortex Swim Spa over a conventional pool as heating a very large volume of water is expensive.
