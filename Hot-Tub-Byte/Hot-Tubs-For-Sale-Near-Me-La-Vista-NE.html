<p>When you have made the decision to buy a Hot Tub then you have to consider carefully where you will locate the Jacuzzi Hot Tub. This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>

The features usually include illumination, jets ergonomic seating, control panels, and the dual-zone for heating to offer a dual experience of the hot tub to relax and another zone of the swim section for workouts.</p>

The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo. To prevent this, take specified breaks from the exercise to drink water, and ensure that at least a half gallon of water is being consumed each day - to prevent these swimming dehydration risks.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

The warm, small body of water can be a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.</p>
