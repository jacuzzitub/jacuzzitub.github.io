<p>With the popularity of hot tubs as household items, more and more people are going to hot tub dealers to purchase one for their own use. Raised push buttons also make operating the light, air, and whirlpool systems extremely easy. In the late 1960s, Roy Jacuzzi, a third-generation Jacuzzi toyed with the idea of marketing the pump-fitted bath tub dubbed the 'Roman Bathtub' to cater for the growing need for leisure. When Swim Spas first came on the market about 10 years ago, they were priced in the $25,000 range. By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>They gave me a great price on the hot tub and the entire experience was great. Besides hydromassage, there are hot tubs with chromotherapy that, thanks to underwater lights, emit rays of colored lights able to infuse energy and balance while ameliorating the mood. From jet placement to optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a JACUZZI® Hot Tub is a showcase in quality design. They soon created a tub with a built-in jet whirlpool, which took off in popularity.</p>
<p>The hot water afterward will release the tension in your muscles from your workouts which gives you the perfect combination for a better environment to increase your exercise quality. We are your spa, hot tub and swim spa specialist. If you're looking for more of a massage to the muscles, then a whirlpool system is a better choice. Any requests for change of site location must first be approved in writing by Clearwater Spas.</p>
<p>Enjoy the best of both worlds: a relaxing spa pool and water-based exercise swim spa in the comfort of your backyard. One of the top concerns when dealing with a Jacuzzi bathtub is the growth of bacteria and mold within the jets and tubing. Bring along somebody who already has a Hot Tub or has experience of using a hot tub if you are at all unsure of what you should be looking for when evaluating the possible purchase.</p>
<h3>Swim Spa Accessories Merrill</h3>
<p>The relaxation brought about by a hot tub bath will be quite beneficial if you are suffering from high blood pressure. And swimming is an activity that you can do. Many people like this activity because it offers many benefits. It's tempting as you're cruising the aisles of big box stores to fall for really cheap chlorine that's says for Pools and hot tubs”.

<p>Some models use an air blower to force air through a separate set of jets for a different "bubbly" massage effect; this is a separate system from the induced air. Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices. This process is particularly crucial for spas which are manufactured in extreme weather environments e.g., very hot, very cold or humid conditions.</p>
<p>Since private pools are used exclusively by a few people, these swimming pools are usually smaller than public pools. Spa and hot tub water therapies are highly valued for their relaxing, rejuvenating, and naturally rehabilitative qualities, and hot tubs remain a favorite social setting. Our standard wood-fired hot tubs are equipped with NO jets and filters. Some people like a little bit of texture that gives you a feel similar to that of an in ground hot tub.</p>
<p>Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12′ - 24′ in length. The unique shell design of the MP line of swim spas gives you a long and wide swim area with no hidden obstacles like benches or steps to hit your feet. Avoid hot tubs if you can during those 9 months. If you are looking for a free-standing pool with heated water, hydrotherapy jets, filtration system and one that is semi-permanent then a hot tub is what you need.</p>
