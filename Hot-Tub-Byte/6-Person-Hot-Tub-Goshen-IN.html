Whether your choice of exercise is running, walking, jogging, or working out at the gym, the fitness of hot tubs and spas are just what you need for those tired, aching muscles at affordable prices.

<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub.

<p>Besides scrubbing down your Jacuzzi every so often, you must make sure all water is removed from the jetted tub after each use. In this way the water is directed to all the parts of the body and provides the massage. Today spas are frequently attached to hotels and sports complexes and come in a variety of different sizes and configurations. Draining & refilling of your spa or hot tub on a regular basis is the simplest, single best thing you can do to control odors.</p>
