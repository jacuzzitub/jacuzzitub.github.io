<p>According to Wikipedia : a Hot Tub is a large tub or small pool full of heated water and used for hydrotherapy or pleasure. Add warmth and water movement and hot tubbing becomes the stuff of lifetime memories. If you do use a hot tub, turn down the temperature and limit your time in the water to less than 10 minutes. A Spa system will use air to push the water around your bath and create that bubble and whirl effects.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property.

<h3>Hot Tub And Jacuzzi Maryville TN 37803</h3>
<p>This flexibility has allowed thousands of people to realize the dream of "endless" swimming at their own home. Quite simply, a Swim Spa is a machine that allows you to swim continuously against a water current. During the mid-2000's, a few keen hot tub manufacturers saw that there might be a larger market opening up in the Swim Spa industry, and a number of them changed their production lines to also produce the larger, more bulky Swim Spas.</p>
<p>One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas. Most people see improvement in their symptoms when they simply stop going in hot tubs, but some people may need treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, according to a 2006 study from the Mayo Clinic. On Endless Pools' website, you can build your own swim spa and see a price quote right away, making it the only company we evaluated that posts all prices up front.</p>
<p>All swim spa covers are made specifically to fit your Master Spas swim spa and come 6" thick in the middle and taper off to 4". This cover includes an energy efficient 1.5 lb foam density and a 24 R-value, with a full length heat seal and upgraded rubber grip handles (included!). We had limited space and the swim spa allowed us to maximise the use of our garden and has proven to be far more economical than a pool.</p>
