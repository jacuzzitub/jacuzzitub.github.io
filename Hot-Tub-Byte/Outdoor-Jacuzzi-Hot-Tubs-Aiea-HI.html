<p>When people refer to a hot tub or a spa, they often think of the word Jacuzzi. Many of our customers have commented that since owning a swim spa it has reduced the amount of screen time their kids want and increased their physical activity. Come in and see our line of quality swim spas. Spa pools sit well on outdoor decked areas that flow comfortably off your house. For nearly thirty years, Endless Pools has been the top choice has been the top choice of people from casual swimmers to professional athletes all seeking an attractive alternative to in-ground pools or bulky home exercise equipment.</p>
<p>Endless Pools' swim spas range in size from 1,200 gallons up to 2,395 gallons. Professional swim spa that uses bigger pumps, more power and specialised swim jets to create a smoother type of water flow and the ultimate swim experience. The Exerswim Propulsion System is what makes the difference between the H2X and the other swim spas. If you choose a pool with a powerful water current, you can easily swim, exercise, get a full body workout, rehabilitate, relax, and still have plenty of fun.</p>
<h2>Spa Tube Aiea Hawaii</h2>
<p>Multiple conditioning grills smooth and redirect the water, resulting in a swim current that is free of turbulence. Jacuzzi designed the CLEARRAY water purification system, which uses an exclusive ultraviolet light filter to remove bacteria from your spa water. A swim spa can combine all the wonderful, healthful properties of swimming that a lake, ocean, or pool can as well as those of a spa in which you can relieve yourself of the stresses of your day.</p>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>In a May 2016 article, LiveScience gives several tips on how to keep kids safe around pools and hot tubs and reduce the risk of drowning. The jacuzzi tub affects the mind and body to feel you refreshing. One of the first steps to opening a pool is removing the pool cover, but before you do so, clean the deck area to prevent debris from being swept into the swimming pool. Please feel free to browse our selection of hot tubs and spas and call us with any questions.</p>
<h3>Jacuzzi Products, Collections And More Aiea</h3>
<p>Note: With the exception of Hydropool's Self-Cleaning swim spas , almost all mid-range and high-end swim spas still utilize hot tub filtration systems, despite using other specialized swim spas parts such as pumps and jets. Bio-film removing products further prevent bio-film build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>

Hot Springs Resort and Spa has a licensed and professional Massage Therapists and Estheticians that provide a variety of relaxing and rejuvenating treatments. Swim spas are an excellent way to get a full body workout in a compact space and are perfect for people that love swimming, but don't have room for a large swimming pool.</p>
<p>These tubs have a 75 gallon capacity and is a great soaker bath to ease the stress away. First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment. Obviously when outside the Hot tub will be more exposed to the elements and you will need to wear bath slippers or equivalent as you walk to the Jacuzzi to keep the water as clear as possible.</p>
