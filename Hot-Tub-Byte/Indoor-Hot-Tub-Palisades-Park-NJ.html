<p>Every time summer comes, people start getting restless and try to finds ways to beat the heat. The major ways are sexual intercourse, wiping from back to front after urinating, and sometimes from soaking in warm water. Vortex Spas are plumbed using Duraflex flexible PVC plumbing, which is specially designed for use in high performance swim spas. A swim spa is fundamentally a smaller version of a pool and can come in different sizes according to what you want. There have been deaths due to drowning in hot tubs attributed to alcohol use.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>
