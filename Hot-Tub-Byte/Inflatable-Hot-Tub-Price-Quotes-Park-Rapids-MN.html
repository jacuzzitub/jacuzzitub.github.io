<p>What better way to spend a romantic break away, than to choose an accommodation with a hot tub or spa. Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<p>The maintenance of the spa is of great concern to all the owners of swim spas. Known for innovation, Jacuzzi is the company that started the modern hot tub industry. Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub. The best thing about a Swim Spa is that it eliminates the need for a full-sized swimming pool and a spa and thus cuts back on the amount of space needed.</p>

Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side.
