<p>You walk out to use your spa or hot tub and immediately you know something is wrong. The risk of catching this type of infection in a hot tub is increased because the high water temperatures can cause disinfectants, such as chlorine , to break down faster, according to the CDC. Other optional features in some varieties of Jacuzzi tubs include a mood light, heater, and even a water-level sensor. Tips- to save time (if your able) disconnect the hot water from washer and connect a hose. Both styles offer heat seam pillows that prevent heat loss through the seams of your spa and upgraded rubber grip handles.</p>
<p>For example, people with multiple sclerosis should avoid a swim spa because warm water can exacerbate symptoms, while people with arthritis tend to prefer a pool that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. People often wonder when is the best time to buy a hot tub, and the answer can vary depending upon several factors. The pump within your spa pool determines the overall quality and functioning of your whole spa.</p>

They soon created a tub with a built-in jet whirlpool, which took off in popularity.</p>

<h3>Hot Tubs, Spas, Chemicals, Accessories & Service Yonkers</h3>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>

<p>The Hydrozone Plunge has no swim jets and two pumps. Our decision was based on expert knowledge, common sense advice regarding running costs, information about water cleanliness and about the necessary foundations for the product, delivery and set up and of course on the significant therapeutic benefits the spa will offer to my husband. Arctic Spas® has solutions for these valid concerns with our FreeHeat and Spa Boy® technology greatly lowering your monthly energy costs and to help maintain ideal spa conditions.</p>
<p>It has separate temperature controls for the swimming lane and hot tub which means that someone can be comfortably practicing their stroke at a swimming pool temperature while others can be seated in warmer waters in the hot tub area.
