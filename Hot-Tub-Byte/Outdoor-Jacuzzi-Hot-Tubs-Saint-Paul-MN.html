<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year. Soaking in your hot tub can be a true panacea for your health. Swim spas have this feature wherein you can swim in place for as long as you want.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
