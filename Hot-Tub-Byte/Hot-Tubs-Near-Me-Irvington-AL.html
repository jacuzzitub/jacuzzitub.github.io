<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs. For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>

There are often more jets in an air jetted tub than there are in the water jetted tubs. Many people that suffer from such things as arthritis, obesity, physical disabilities, and even learning disabilities, have all been shown to greatly benefit from swimming pool and spa treatments. With technology advancing everyday, the design of the Jacuzzis started developing and now there are about 250 patents in all in the whirlpool bath and spa industry.</p>
<p>We want to be seen as the brand spearheading innovations in swimspa technology, like our hydraulically balanced plumbing which ensures the correct water pressure to the hydrotherapy jets or the WaveRider Control. Lucky for you, a swim spa can offer a more controlled environment to help your kids learn the basics of swimming. They can also look more attractive than swim spas, thanks to the extensive range of exterior cladding and pool colour choices they offer.</p>
<p>Swim spas vary dramatically in cost depending on size, jet power, features and installation. They have this feature wherein an adjustable water current will be applied in the pool part so you can swim laps and laps without hitting the walls nor turning around. Get all these things right and you will never regret buying a Jacuzzi tub, so seek professional help when selecting a hot tub for your home - you can often try them out at the dealers shop too.</p>
