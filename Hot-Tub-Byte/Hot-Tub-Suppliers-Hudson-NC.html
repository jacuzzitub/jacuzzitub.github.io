<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>You should always have the cover on it when the tub is not in not only keeps the water warm but also keeps the dirt and dust out. Although the words hot tub” and spa” can refer to the same thing here in the U.S., many parts of the world use the word spa” to refer to natural mineral springs.
