For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>

<p>Muscle pain and stiffness cannot remain in your body when the hot, high speed water surrounds you. Most of the hot tubs on Wayfair require a water and electrical source, but if neither are viable in the area where you plan to place your hot tub, a popup hot tub might make more sense.

<p>Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
