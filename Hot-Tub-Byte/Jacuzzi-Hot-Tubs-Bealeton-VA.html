The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone. For more intensive swimming pool cleaning services, purchase a small, portable pump to remove standing water from the cover.</p>

<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower.
