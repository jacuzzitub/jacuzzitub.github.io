<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>Some cheaper swim spas offer long warranties that look good on paper but only actually cover parts.

<p>Saunas induce sweating, which causes a decrease in the body's toxic load and thereby promotes better health. Next, it is important that you check the pH balance of the water in your jacuzzi style hot tub on a regular basis. Some of these are heated in the traditional way with wood fires and there are some companies that rent them out and run experience days where you can use traditional hot tubs in the peace and tranquillity of unspoilt woodland and other open spaces.</p>
