If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>

<p>You want to stay hydrated while soaking and drinking a cool glass” of water, fruit juice or tea is such a pleasant way to go. But it's so easy to drop a glass” made of glass and have it shatter on the way to the tub or once you're soaking.
