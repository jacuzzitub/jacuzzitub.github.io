<p>One of the most obvious benefits of using a swimming pool and spa, for the average person, is the simple act of relaxation. Some cheap Hot Tubs which are usually cheap imports from the East claim to have many Jets but many times there are just simple pin point Jets, which do not rotate, or cross fire and are un-adjustable and in my view not really worth having but can look very enticing to a prospective purchaser. The best advice is that you should see any used hot tub jacuzzi in full working action before you agree to buy it. If, when you go to see it and it is empty of water or is disconnected from the electricity then you should obviously arrange for another visit or wait for it to be reconnected and filled up with water, and turned on.</p>
<p>A Jacuzzi needs to have an energy saver system so as to be more economical in use and also to be more green to the planet - obviously an energy efficient hot tub will save the consumer money and use less precious energy thereby reducing ones carbon footprint which is very politically correct. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>

Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa. Many times, people who choose swim spas are looking to avoid paying more for a swimming pool. Hot tubs refer to large tubs of hot water in which the person bathing is submerged.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump.
