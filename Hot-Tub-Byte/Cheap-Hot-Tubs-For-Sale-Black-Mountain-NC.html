<p>Jacuzzis are among the most popular addition to a luxury bathroom. The circuit breaker can also trip if there is a problem with the ozonator or air blower of your hot tub. SwimLife products are designed to bring to life back to your backyard - through offering a top quality product. Don't forget that if you're pregnant or have heart disease you'll need to avoid using hot tubs and spa baths. Let's face it - hot tubs are hot. One does not use the Finnish sauna for long periods at a time (ideally, not more than two sessions in a day), and exits the sauna room to rinse the body in cold water between sessions.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>A hot tub used to be seen as a luxury item that people could only dream of owning one day. But endless swimming is just the beginning, because modern swim spas offer powerful hydro - massaging jets for complete rejuvenation and relaxation after a hard workout or anytime the mood strikes. Staying fit and living well is easy with the Vitality Series Fitness Spas, pleasing both your wellness goals and budget.</p>
<p>In this part of your swim spa, internal turbines create a current you can swim against, just as you would if you swam in the ocean tide; this gives you the optimal exercise of swimming as a form of strength training in a small, efficient area. Owning a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub allows you to take advantage of a water-based therapeutic technique known as hydrotherapy. These lightweight and robustly constructed tubs are provided with air switch, hand shower, golf waterfall and dream pillow.</p>

<p>This area generally doesn't hold more than one or two people at a time, and its jets mimic those found in traditional hot tubs. Jacuzzi spas' plumbing components are warranted against leaks due to defects in workmanship or materials for five years. Let the experienced team at Paradise Pools & Spas create a space where you can sit back after a long day and feel the tension melt away from your body. It's a good idea to consult your insurance agent and ask specifically what and how your policy would cover claims on the hot tub and how much liability insurance they recommend.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>
<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>Relaxing in a warm jetted hot tub is very relaxing and good for your mental health. Ensure you have plenty of space to fit the hot tub, as well as easy access to the power source and enough room to safely get in and out of the hot tub. Hydropool has swim spas for relaxing, working out and even a little bit of both. Vortex Spas feature advanced water treatment technologies that work together in tandem with a light chemical boost to keep your water crystal clear and healthy.</p>

<p>The heat widens blood vessels, which sends nutrient-rich blood throughout your body. With the optional integrated Wi-Fi module that works with the Balboa Water Group Wi-Fi Spa Control app, you can remotely control how your hot tub operates, including the lighting, water temperature and running massage pumps. Take a look at the photos below, which demonstrate the various types of Swim Spas in different environments.</p>
<p>A night in my hot tub before bed and sometimes I the morning before work. The internet can be a perfect place to purchase a cheap hot tub instead of from a hot tub dealer's showroom, but be careful with internet hot tub retailers as they might not be genuine, they could be selling poor quality hot tubs or not be around in the future to support you with warranty problems or spare parts like filters. Not only the initial cost is lower than swim pools, but the use of water, the required heating, and the chemicals are less due to the size difference.</p>
<p>A massage, body treatment, or esthetics treatment is the perfect addition to your time in our world famous natural hot mineral water. Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect. All swim spas, hot tubs , and Jacuzzis contain jets to mix air with pressurized water to provide a massage experience. Perspiration caused due to a sauna bath helps in opening up skin pores and expulsion of body toxins and impurities.</p>
