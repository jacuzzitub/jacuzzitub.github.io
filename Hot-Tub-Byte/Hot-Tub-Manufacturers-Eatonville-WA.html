<p>Hot tub pumps keep the massage jets powered and also help keep the water clean by circulating the water. Chilling out after a stressful work week can be a tad harder then the self-help books make it out to be. This is where the Wood-Fired Hot Tub comes in. It's a portable, free-standing, wood-fired hot tub that accommodates four adults (make that six if you're very friendly). Swimming in swim spas can even improve your social life due to their effect in making you more relaxed and content. Visit Paradise Spas & Outdoor Living, we serve the Greater Austin area, including Cedar Park Texas, and are excited to offer these unique products.</p>

The Axis Cover System by Master Spas makes swim spa covers for both your H2X and Michael Phelps Swim Spa. Also, hot tubs are pretty easy to maintain, which is what you need if it is going to be something you want to relax in.

The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa.
