<h2>Garden Hot Tubs Coraopolis Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Swim spas and spa pools (also known as portable spas or hot tubs) are very similar.

<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns. The length of your swim spa area should be the height of the tallest swimmer in your household with their arms outstretched plus around a metre so you don't touch the jets or kick the seats while swimming. The health benefits from increased circulation and such that you get from the water jets you do not get with an air jetted bathtub.</p>
