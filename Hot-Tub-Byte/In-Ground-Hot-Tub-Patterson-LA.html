<p>Today, hot tubs are more popular than ever and the number of hot tub owners is steadily rising. The therapy depends on the movement of water for a massage, buoyancy and the laminar current for relaxing your muscles, and the right temperature to offer a wholesome experience. Jacuzzi tubs can also be extremely noisy when in use. In fact, the only tool you will need to install your very own swimming pool is a screwdriver. If you're interested in purchasing a spa, swim spa, plunge pool or Infrared Sauna for your home, but unsure about what is required, please don't hesitate to give us a call today.</p>

<h3>Hot Tub Spas & Home Saunas Patterson</h3>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>Introducing the H2X® premium jetted swim spa, providing an incredible experience all day. This kit has all the chemicals you need to keep the water in your swim spa clear and sanitary, including pH increaser and decreaser, alkalinity increaser and decreaser, calcium booster and a defender chemical to prevent scale build up. The $90 price tag is expensive, but if you perform weekly tests, the chemicals should last for several years.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>
<p>It has the new River Jet swim system with Viper pumps, and plenty of water features. Whisper-quiet motors, colorful lighting, dancing air bubbles, powerful jets — your bath is an expression of yourself and an extension of how you want to feel. Most indoor kinds hold one or two people simply because the available space is limited to the standard size bathroom. Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>

<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location. Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>
<p>Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises.
