<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>Drink water while in the hot tub to cool off your body. We also have many videos right here on our web site where you can see Swim Spas in action, right from your own computer screen. Relaxation is important during pregnancy, and since there are few better ways to relax, you may be tempted to swim in a swim spa or soak in a hot tub. This is the hot tub side of the spa.

<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water.

There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>
<p>Muscle pain and stiffness cannot remain in your body when the hot, high speed water surrounds you. Most of the hot tubs on Wayfair require a water and electrical source, but if neither are viable in the area where you plan to place your hot tub, a popup hot tub might make more sense. After a swimming work-out you can relax in the spa zone and choose from a lounger seat, a neck and shoulder massage seat, 2 back massage seats or the frequently used cool down seat.</p>
