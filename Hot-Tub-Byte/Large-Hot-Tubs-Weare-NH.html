<p>Don't falsely assume that swim spas are only for the richer due to being costly. Jets are located around the sides of the tub and air injectors are located under the seats. For example, it's easy to see you need to buy a Synergy or a TruSwim swim spa if you want cascading water spouts, not a Vitality model. It lets you swim, exercise, play, and entertain; it's the perfect fun-and-fitness solution for family, friends, and solo retreats. Built tough for the great Aussie outdoors, your spa pool or swim spa will last, backed by our lifetime care commitment.</p>
<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs. For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>
