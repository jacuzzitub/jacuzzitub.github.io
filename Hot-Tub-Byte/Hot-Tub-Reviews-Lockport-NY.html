<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>If your hot tub is freestanding, you will need to provide steps so that people can climb into the tub and step onto the seating area. While there are many similarities between an exercise spa, lap pool and swim spa, securing a great deal comes from understanding exactly what you are looking for and why. We provide this Jacuzzi bathtub on several designs & other related options as per the needs of customers.</p>

<p>Over the past 2 years we've been helping customers with swim spas determine the best care program for their individual needs and addressing their individual concerns.
