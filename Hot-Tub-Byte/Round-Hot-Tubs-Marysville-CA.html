<p>It is best to run the water tests everyday to ensure the purity of the hot-tub water. No swimming pool experience would be complete without room for water toys. All Vortex Swim Spas have topside recesses to place your glasses and bottles. Even if you don't feel comfortable doing this in a showroom where the hot tubs are for sale, you should get into the shell and test the comfort level of the seats. Remember that swim spas are mechanical products and like a car you'll need replacement parts from time to time.</p>
<p>Although the larger Jacuzzi family thought this idea was a little weird, the sales grew and soon the bathtub was designed to be a bit larger so as to fit in 2 people. In Jacuzzi an electric heater can be installed to enjoy hot whirling water. Residential or home pools are sometimes built-in or assembled above ground. Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>
