Start by thinking about how you plan to use the swim spa — therapy, relaxation, exercise or all of the above. The Jacuzzi water heater model is the king of them all.</p>
<p>The tiny jets that circle a sauna bath can shoot out water at an incredibly fast rate, and placing the penis in front of those jets could provide men with quite a thrill.
