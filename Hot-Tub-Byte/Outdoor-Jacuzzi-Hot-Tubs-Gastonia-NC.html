<p>Hot tubs are a great way to relax after a long day at work. For best results, we recommend that you clean your whirlpool bathtub after each use. Both offer jets optimized for massage and both models allow for full body soaks. And because swim spas are usually larger than normal spa pools you have more room for relaxing or more room for family and friends. They currently stock two brands of swimming pool chemicals, Fi-Clor and Swimfresh, both are highly regarded brands that are tested thoroughly for optimum safety.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi hot tub is the name that defines the relaxation experience social & private, fun & cheering, exciting & the best. If you do buy a second hot tub you will not of course have the many advantages that come with buying a new unit but you should perhaps ask for a limited guarantee from the vendor and if buying from a second hand dealer in Hot Tubs then you certainly in my view should get a limited guarantee of some kind.</p>

<p>Jets and waterfalls are also features that can come with the hot tub to add to the relaxing benefits and ambiance. Kit comes with pumps, pipelines from Jacuzzi to pump suction and from pump delivery to Jacuzzi Nozzles Header for Water with necessary fittings. Thankfully, chemicals in a whirlpool bath can kill sperm quickly, and a woman who is simply sitting in the water isn't in an active, "open" position that would allow sperm to enter.</p>

The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7′ x 12′ to 10′ x 16′ with water depths up to 6′ deep.

Please feel free to browse our selection of hot tubs and spas and call us with any questions.</p>
<h3>Should I Get A Hot Tub Or Swim Spa Gastonia</h3>
<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms. Swim spas are extremely easy and convenient when it comes to their use, cleaning, and installing. You should always check that all the pumps and blowers are working and that the heater control lights indicate that the heater is on when the spa is calling for heat.</p>
<p>There are seven base swim spa models to customize at Arctic Spas: Hudson, Kingfisher, Wolverine, Ocean, Athabascan and Okanagan. Jacuzzi walk-in tubs have in-line heaters to maintain the water temperature. Jacuzzi Spas helps you get your daily restorative soothing soak in as part of your well-being routine. You can personalize your PDC Spas swim spa with audio features and LED lights. With so many benefits it is no wonder why swim spas are so popular.</p>
<p>The first way that we can prevent dehydration while swimming is to ensure that proper amounts of water are being consumed. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tub is built using state-of-the-art machinery, taking pride in carrying on the Jacuzzi® legacy of quality. An advantage of having a small hot tub is that it makes it a lot easier to get it into gardens as many small tubs are designed to be fit through a standard door therefore there is no expense for a crane to get the tub into the garden and it makes it easier to carry the tub into your garden.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level.

<p>These same rules apply at residential spas, hot tubs and pools, too. Hot tub folliculitis is a type of skin infection on the hair follicles which is brought about by immersion in a hot tub with unclean water. If you break out in itchy spots after using a hot tub, you may have "hot tub rash." It's one of the more common illnesses linked to hot tubs , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in. Units with such heaters cost more and do use more electricity. Jacuzzi tubs come in a variety of sizes and shapes such as round, square, oval, kidney shaped.</p>
<p>With Jacuzzi for Life, you have the option of purchasing any 300, 400, 500 or LX series hot tub. Innovative jet pump & equipment technology and newer manufacturing methods made the cost of production of the Swim Spa to come down to the levels of a high quality portable hot tub. The biggest factor to consider in terms of cost is the price of the Jacuzzi bathtub itself. Many people ask themselves if it's worth it to invest in a swim spa.</p>
