<p>I have been asked this question by so many customers. You can purchase the Jacuzzi Luxura Bath Tub that will cost you about $559.00. This is the perfect bath tub for a consumer that may be on a tighter budget. It takes only 10-20 minutes in a hot tub to raise your body temperature to 102º F or higher,” the article states. The Swim Spa is the perfect balance for those who want the best of both worlds, swimming and relaxing. The main parts of a hot tub pump are the wet end and the motor end.</p>
<p>A hot tub may be covered as an other structure by some insurance policies. However, this can negatively impact the swimming experience, which is the focal point of purchasing a swim spa. This is not very critical in the maintenance of your Hot Tub but of course, a pleasing visual appeal of clear water will considerably add to the experience. Built-in features like handrails, seats and textured floors add to the safety of using a bathtub.</p>

<p>This is a spa that is offered at a fitness club or a recreational club as an added facility. Unlike a swimming pool which can be quite costly to install and requires a large backyard, swim spas offer this all-in-one portable package in a box that can be craned into position in an hour. If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
