A massage, body treatment, or esthetics treatment is the perfect addition to your time in our world famous natural hot mineral water. Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect. All swim spas, hot tubs , and Jacuzzis contain jets to mix air with pressurized water to provide a massage experience.

<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
