<p>Hot tubs serve their purpose well in reducing stress and muscle tension from our body-from an adult body used to extreme temperatures. The hotel facility includes an indoor swimming pool, a whirlpool , a sauna, massages, a children's playground and free parking. Keep in mind both swim spas and spas are optimised for different water types, depending on your preference.
