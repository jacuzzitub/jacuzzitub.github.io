<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Introducing the all-new Endless Pools® Fitness Systems. The Synergy Series feature two high-powered Elite Pro jets for a variety of family fun and fitness opportunities. On this website, you will get lots of information related to the best types of hot tubs. If the spa you are considering does not offer this it is likely a sign that they have not used quality products in the manufacturing of their jets. But if you are willing to put up with cheaper construction, a less powerful motor, and higher lifetime heating costs, the difference in purchase price between the two hot tubs might make buying the less expensive one a perfectly reasonable decision.</p>

You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go.

Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>

PDC Swim Spas and Fitness Spas are where innovation and fitness meet for a new approach to a healthier, happier lifestyle.
