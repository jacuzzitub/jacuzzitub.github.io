<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>

<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs.

The Jacuzzi for Life customer will also receive a new Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub every three years. Jacuzzi TargetPro jets combine power with higher water flow and air integration for a more vigorous and even massage.</p>
<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well. These centers usually have more than one pool which caters to guests of different swimming requirements. These bacteria are found naturally in water, and hot tubs that aren't disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella, according to the CDC.</p>
