<p>When you own a hot tub or spa you certainly need to make sure you have some protection for it such as one of the quality spa covers that are available. The HL 630 Healthy Living model is one of the best-selling spas in the Healthy Living series. This acrylic hot tub is probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Jacuzzi in your garden. It caters for all of your relaxation, exercise & entertainment needs in one luxury swim spa.

<p>From time to time water is thrown on heated stones, producing a thick cloud of steam and making the room feel hotter. Internal turbines power the part in which you can swim; these generate a current that you swim against - as you would swim against a tide in the ocean - giving you optimal exercise every time you go for a swim. Just about anything you can think of in these type tubs can be installed and operating in a matter of no more than a couple hours time.</p>
