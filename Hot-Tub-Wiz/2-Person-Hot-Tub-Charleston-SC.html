<p>It is so restful to be able to have a long relaxing soak in a hot tub. When you exercise in one of these spas, you will be utilizing every muscle group in your body in a controlled setting. Given that the skill level to install a Jacuzzi bathtub is fairly high, most homeowners hire a pro. It produces a certain water current that allows you to swim there for as long as you want without hitting any walls. We had a jacuzzi tub in our old home and the jets never seemed clean no matter what I tried.</p>
<p>There are many different benefits associated with using Jacuzzi hot tubs for hydrotherapy.

<p>The major ways are sexual intercourse, wiping from back to front after urinating, and sometimes from soaking in warm water. Vortex Spas are plumbed using Duraflex flexible PVC plumbing, which is specially designed for use in high performance swim spas. A swim spa is fundamentally a smaller version of a pool and can come in different sizes according to what you want. There have been deaths due to drowning in hot tubs attributed to alcohol use.</p>
<p>Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>There is a selling season for hot tubs, spas and swim spas and it begins in spring when consumers start venturing in their backyards again and it ends when the kids are back in school and the holidays begin. Experience the ease of owning your own swim spa and feel the benefits of a healthier lifestyle. Whether it be relaxing in one of many different spas and hot tubs, enjoying a soothing sauna tub, this can help make your family gatherings a joy.</p>

In addition, swimming against swim jets is a very different experience to swimming against a natural water current. So if your swim spa's shell structure fails anytime within the 10 year warranty, we replace it. No questions asked.</p>
