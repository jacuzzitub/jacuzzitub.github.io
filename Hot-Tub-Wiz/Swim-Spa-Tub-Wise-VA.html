<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. People can ask the hot tub operator if the disinfectant and pH levels are checked at least twice a day. The need of Indian families for small spa with swimming facility was felt long so Arrdev have come up with swim spa which is suitable for the small space and can be accommodated in just 100 sqft (10 sqmeter). Clearwater Spas warrants their spa shell interior surface against blistering, cracking and delamination for 10 years from the original purchase date.</p>
