<p>Perhaps one may want to enjoy and own your very own Hot Tub but you are just not able to justify the cost of a brand new one. Only the Swim Spa WaterWatch® tracks distance and monitors performance, heart rate, calories and more while offering real time results and feedback. With a Coast Spas Wellness Spa® you'll sleep and feel better, increase your fitness and stamina, elevate your mood as well as lower your blood pressure. From time to time it may become necessary to update or change our Privacy Statement and ThermoSpas encourages you to periodically check here for the most current version.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>

The most efficient way to heat a swim spa is with a heat pump which uses air conditioning technology to heat heater for up to 75% less than an electric heater. You would come over and set up the portable hot tub, and then come back when they are done with it and pick it back up. You would set it up for them, and give them a quick demonstration, and tell them to have a great time.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>

<p>Many pools don't have the option to be heated which makes them impossible to use during the cold days of winter.

A quality heat pump is the best way that you can ensure your running costs are the lowest they can be. You should always ensure that a heat pump is fitted to any swim spa or spa pool that you are considering purchasing. We start out with 12 ft swim spas and go up to 16 ft swim spa models.

A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>
<p>C) a combination of spa seats and recliners (usually in a u shape at the end opposite the swim jets). Jacuzzi also has a very popular line of bathtubs called Fuzion.
