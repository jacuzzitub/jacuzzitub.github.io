It is true that athletes can exercise, relieve muscle tension and improve their over all athletic performance through the use of a swimming pool and spa. Because of their flexible designs, modern hot tubs can be used in a multitude of settings. Many articles and clinics cover the intricacies of how this can be improved however; stroke rate or tempo is of equal importance for faster swimming.</p>

<p>Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out.
