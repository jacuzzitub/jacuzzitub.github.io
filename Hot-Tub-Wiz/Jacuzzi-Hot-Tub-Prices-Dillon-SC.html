<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill.

<h3>The Difference Between A Whirlpool And A Jacuzzi Dillon</h3>
<p>A therapeutic spa and swimming pool combined into one, swim spas are designed with more space for exercise and play at one end and the benefits of hydro massage at the other. She won a free Jacuzzi® J-245 hot tub. In comparison to maintenance and heating of an average inbuilt swimming pool, swim spas are lower on running costs. Your sore aching neck and back muscles will love our spas water and air jets. We are proud to be your online retailer of H2X swim spa covers and Michael Phelps swim spas covers.</p>
<p>In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that heat rises, it is the spa cover that contains this heat. We put family with a firm focus on kids at the forefront of our mind when we set about designing our range of swim spas. Before any piece of Jacuzzi® Pro Grade Pool Equipment leaves the factory, it is thoroughly tested in a state-of-the-art facility. Quality spas provide their owners with years of use and reliable performance. An H2X Fitness Swim Spa by Master Spas combines the benefits of water exercise with the therapy of a hot tub so you can own your wellness and win your day.</p>
<p>Four pumps give this piece of equipment a lot of water flow, for therapy and exercise. Funny you should ask, because we happen to have a video that produced in 2008 at the Artesian Spas factory in Las Vegas, NV. The video is actually called "How Do They Build A Hot Tub Spa?", but the model that they are building in the video happens to be a large 16' Swim Spa. Unless you've specifically added additional coverage for your hot tub, any damages to it may not be covered by your regular policy.</p>
