<p>Interior design is about creating a harmonious space to live in, about creating exciting and functional environments in your home. Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
<p>Swimming spas are typically smaller compared to the size of a regular swimming pool. Jacuzzi TheraPro jets are fully adjustable and customizable and designed to direct the whirlpool action to any desired target area. You can step into a Jacuzzi hot tub knowing you will enjoy the benefits of hydrotherapy for years to come. However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
