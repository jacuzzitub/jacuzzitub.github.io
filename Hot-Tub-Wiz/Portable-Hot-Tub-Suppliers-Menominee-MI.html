<h3>Hot Tubs, Spas, Chemicals, Accessories & Service Menominee</h3>
<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own. In short, hot tubs and Jacuzzis are not the same. Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
<p>Hot water is a great way to keep the body moving. A Jacuzzi soaking tub is the most common type of tub, and this basic concept is Jacuzzi's foundation for hydrotherapy tubs. Some hot tubs also come with features that Jacuzzi products do not, such as flat-screen TVs and built-in MP3 audio systems. Our Swim Spa River Jets are each powered solely by a 4 HP (6BHP) Hyper Flow Jet Pump. Having the swim spa completely above ground is another option that allows you to fence only the steps (as long as the swim spa is over 1200mm high the height of pool fencing).</p>

Ideally, swim spa workouts are combined with a basic land based exercise program” for optimal results.</p>

As well as ensuring that your spa has an incorporated heat pump, make sure that the spa pool or swim spa control system has been adapted to accommodate this. The luxurious bathroom comes with double vanity, rain shower and roll-top bathtub and offers uninterrupted views of the lagoon beyond.</p>
