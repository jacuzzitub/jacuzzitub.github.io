<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. A system of heaters and jets keep it bubbling, which create satisfying massaging sensation and eventually work as an excellent anecdote to anxiety and stress. Get the portability of an above-the-ground pool , the endless swimming of a lap pool, and the hydrotherapy of a hot tub all rolled into one. Above ground swim spas also have the added advantage of being portable, so that if you ever decide to move house, you can take your swim spa with you, enabling you to get the most out of your investment.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi is simply a brand name of hot tub. Deluxe 6-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge. Swim spa: This is a small pool that uses powerful jets to propel water toward you so you can get a workout by swimming against the tide, so to speak. These signs should make you a lot more cautious about buying that particular hot tub, although more often than not a lack of treating the water will not harm the performance of the spa.</p>

<p>Welcome to TidalFit — the answer to swimming, aquatic fitness and soothing massage in one. During this time, I continued to watch the growth and increase in popularity of free standing, self-contained swim spas, however, the quality and performance of these spas simply did not meet my standards and expectations. When you come back after the rental time is done, you would empty the water, and take the hot tub away.</p>
