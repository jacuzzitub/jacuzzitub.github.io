A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door.

He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>
