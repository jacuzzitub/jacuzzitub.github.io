<p>Family owned Sacramento dealer offering affordable high quality Turbo Spas and Swim Spas. Swimming in a swim spa adds extra benefits. That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>Instead of forking out more than $70k on a pool, many resorts to owning a spa swim that started with $14k. Swim spas can be used for many types of exercise, beyond the invigorating workouts you get swimming against the resistance current. In contrast to a typical bathtub , a hot tub is designed to be used by more than one person at a time, with many models accommodating four or more people. There are many companies that carry jetted tubs, some of the most well known include American Standard and Whirlpool bathtubs.</p>

<p>Additionally, these swim spas are extremely relaxing and induce hydrotherapy with massaging jets and contour seating. If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>
<p>The offered acrylic bathtub is designed from the best material & latest technology in accordance with the norms of market. This is even more important if you don't plan on using the bathtub again for several days. An electric heater can also be installed for enjoying hot whirling water in Jacuzzi. This is a full-sized swimming pool with a spa section added, so the whole family can enjoy the pool while you are chilling out in the spa, or you can enjoy some relaxing hydrotherapy after concentrating on your lap times.</p>
<p>In a May 2016 article, LiveScience gives several tips on how to keep kids safe around pools and hot tubs and reduce the risk of drowning. The jacuzzi tub affects the mind and body to feel you refreshing. One of the first steps to opening a pool is removing the pool cover, but before you do so, clean the deck area to prevent debris from being swept into the swimming pool. Please feel free to browse our selection of hot tubs and spas and call us with any questions.</p>
