<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
<p>Don't forget that apart from the initial purchase expense, there will be monthly expenses for maintaining Jacuzzi tubs Those expenses will be the electricity to keep the water at the right temperature, chemicals to keep the ph levels safe and water to keep it at the right level. The Hydrozone has comfortable seating for the entire family, up to 68 jets, up to four high volume swim jets and 5 pumps. I had been swimming regularly at a public pool and found it crowded and chemically distasteful.</p>
