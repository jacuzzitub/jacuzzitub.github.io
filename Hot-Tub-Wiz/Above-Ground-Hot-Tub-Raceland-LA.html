<p>What better way to spend a romantic break away, than to choose an accommodation with a hot tub or spa. Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
<p>This is also how hot tubs take away stress. Hot tubs are unlike saunas, steam- and Turkish baths, which are steam only. You can easily assemble a swim spa together and use it as a portable swimming pool, wherever you go. Positioned to hit your shoulders and torso (jets that are too far apart or too low will not create the required resistance against the body and are a waste of water flow). Spas should also have a diverter valve to maintain water pressure on 1 or 2 seats.</p>
