<p>We all know the benefits of owning a swimming pool. Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
<p>It has the performance and style synonymous with Jacuzzi®, and is the ideal introduction to the many benefits of hydrotherapy that its classic jets can deliver. You still get jet options to concentrate water sprays to various parts of the body for a soothing water massage. Jacuzzi pump parts and most any type of seals are available online, but be sure to get the right kit for your particular pump type and brand.</p>
