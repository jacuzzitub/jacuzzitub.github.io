After an active day on the slopes, it is worth relaxing at the hotel's wellness centre with an indoor swimming pool, Jacuzzi and sauna. The warm, small body of water can be a breeding ground for harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side.
