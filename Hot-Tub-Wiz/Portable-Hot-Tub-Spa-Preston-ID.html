<p>Interior design is about creating a harmonious space to live in, about creating exciting and functional environments in your home. Regular cleaning and well maintained spas last for a very long time. The cabinet contains all major components of the Hot Tub Jacuzzi such as pumps, plumbing ,motors and heaters, etc.,. This is what earns the Hot Tub the description of being "portable" the in ground spas are of course not portable but on all those cases they have a separate pump house away from the Jacuzzi. Both the Finestra and Jacuzzi Walk-in Tub lines come with the RapidHeat in-line heater which maintains the water temperature longer, Fast-fill and Quick Drain which fill and drain the tub two times faster than standard faucets and drains, heated seats and backrests.</p>
<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool.

<p>Browse through the catalogs to find premium quality corner bathtubs, couple bathtubs, oval bathtubs, round series bathtubs, jacuzzis bathtubs, etc. Pay a little more and you'll get a better swimming experience, better components and lower running costs. You would usually work your entire backyard around a dedicated swimming pool area, but a swim spa will fit into a much smaller backyard or outdoor alfresco area.</p>
<p>Many swim spas come with a PH tester kit, but you can also purchase one separately. The Ergo Group deals with the finest quality outdoor and luxury products and is proud to partner with Jacuzzi® through Hydrolife. Likewise, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect luxury item that will help you increase the overall value of your home. The plumbing system of all Vortex swim spas is warranted against leaking for 5 years. If you've never learned how to swim you should take lessons at your local pool to learn the basics, but after that it is simply a matter of swimming length after length.</p>
<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
