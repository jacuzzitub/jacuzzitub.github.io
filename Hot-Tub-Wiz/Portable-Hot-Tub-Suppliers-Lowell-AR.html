<p>Choose from a Whirlpool bath or Salon Spa for one of two bathers. 2. Fibre glass swimming pool for six people.

Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers. Swimming pools make a great sand-less alternative, but laps in a public pool aren't always possible, and, of course, not private, and installing and maintaining your own pool may be too costly, not to mention the fact that you can't take it with you if you move or you may simply not have the space to accommodate one.</p>

By having a smaller tub the volume of water is a lot less therefore running cost are reduced due to the heater having less water to heat.</p>
