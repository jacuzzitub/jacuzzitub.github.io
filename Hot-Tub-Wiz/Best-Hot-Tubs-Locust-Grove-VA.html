<p>At the end of a long day, few things are better than soaking in a bubbly hot tub. If you really love your swim spa or hot tub and want to use it while you are pregnant, you can set the temperature lower, stay in less than 10 minutes, take your temperature, and pay close attention to any feelings of discomfort or sweating. This hot tub has a whopping 120 jets which users say recreates a proper Jacuzzi-style spa in their home. Vinegar can be used as a cleaning agent for hot tubs and is gentle enough that it will not harm any of the working parts or the tub itself.</p>
<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>

<p>As swim spas are usually purchased by people with limited space, the average models are quite small compared to a full sized pool. Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget.
