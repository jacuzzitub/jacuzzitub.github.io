If you want to heat your swim spa at all you need to consider buying a dual zone swim spa so you can use the electric heater(s) to affordably heat just the spa end only and take the edge off” the temperature in the swim end. This is due to the types of pumps, swim jets and plumbing used by many brands and the fact that they do not understand the technology involved.</p>

Even if you don't feel comfortable doing this in a showroom where the hot tubs are for sale, you should get into the shell and test the comfort level of the seats. Remember that swim spas are mechanical products and like a car you'll need replacement parts from time to time.</p>
<p>Although the larger Jacuzzi family thought this idea was a little weird, the sales grew and soon the bathtub was designed to be a bit larger so as to fit in 2 people. In Jacuzzi an electric heater can be installed to enjoy hot whirling water. Residential or home pools are sometimes built-in or assembled above ground. Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>
