Using the 3 jets to swim, the 4 spa seats or just relaxing in the water with just the array of coloured lights tuned on the swim spa is everything and more we expected it to be. Great for exercise and great for relaxing.</p>
<p>The maintenance of the spa is of great concern to all the owners of swim spas. Known for innovation, Jacuzzi is the company that started the modern hot tub industry.

Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub. The best thing about a Swim Spa is that it eliminates the need for a full-sized swimming pool and a spa and thus cuts back on the amount of space needed.</p>

<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time.
