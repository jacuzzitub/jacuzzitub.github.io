<p>Depending on how you use the Hot Tub and the people that actually use it you should fully drain and inspect your hot tub say every three to six months. The paddlewheel current allows people to swim side by side, and there's also an area of still water for people who prefer that. We have installed spa pools across Australia, from Canberra to Brisbane, to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in. Units with such heaters cost more and do use more electricity. Jacuzzi tubs come in a variety of sizes and shapes such as round, square, oval, kidney shaped.</p>
<p>Given its background, the options that Jacuzzi offers elevates bathing from a cleaning session to a bathing experience you'd find in a spa. Relax with massaging spa jets in the perfect water temperature, year-round. The self-cleaning option helps keep the jets and the tubing that runs throughout the Jacuzzi bathtub clean. The you must consider also that where a hot tub is subject to regular use it will accumulate natural body oils, perspiration, and other material that may mark the water line.</p>
