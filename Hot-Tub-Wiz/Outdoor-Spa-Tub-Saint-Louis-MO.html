<h3>The Top Jacuzzis For The Money Saint Louis</h3>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body. Also the green view is one that is very much listened to by the hot tub industry resulting in much more ecological friendly Hot Tubs. By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>
<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body. With 60 years of experience in manufacturing and a legacy of quality products, you can trust that Jacuzzi® understands quality and is focused on customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>Many have what is known as thermal” spa facilities which basically means that there will be hydrotherapy pools, possibly steam rooms, ice caves, salt steam rooms, feature showers and maybe saunas at different temperatures. However, larger swim spas have dual-zone” heating; the primary section for the workouts is cold, while the second one for relaxing is hot. The time-tested performance, attractive appearance and obvious quality is apparent to everyone desiring a no-hassle cover lift.</p>
<p>Of course, we also looked at the swim spa systems each company offers. Spa (also hot tub): Unlike swim spas, these are made for relaxation. The Hydrozone Pro has two powerful swim jets and three pumps, while the Pro Plus has three swim jets and four pumps and the Hydrozone Extreme is the ultimate with four powerful swim jets and five pumps.
