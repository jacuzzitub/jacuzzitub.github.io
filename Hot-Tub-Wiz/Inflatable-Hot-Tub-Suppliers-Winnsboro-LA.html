<p>The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>
