The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>

Overall, considering the amount of features a swim spa has, it does offer good value, making it an attractive option, particularly if you are on a budget.
