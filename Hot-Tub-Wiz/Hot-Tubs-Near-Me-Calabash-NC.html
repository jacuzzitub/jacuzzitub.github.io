<p>We all know that buying hot tubs isn't a joke. The modular design also allows for pools of varying sizes from 7' x 12' to 10' x 16' with water depths up to 6' deep. The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>When replacing or repairing a hot tub pump, it is always a good idea to make sure the existing pump cord is free from nicks or even shorts and that the ends are not corroded. There are usually a couple of different water circuits, with one heating and filtering the water, the other operating the hydrotherapy jets. Some hot tubs on the market may contain air injectors. Stepping into your Jacuzzi® hot tub in your garden allows you to sit back, relax and enjoy the view whilst enjoying a warm and relaxing spa experience at home.</p>
