This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas.

Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
