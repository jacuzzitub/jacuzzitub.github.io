Swim spas have most of the benefits of a swimming pool but can be installed into a smaller space and are much cheaper. Swim spas with a powerful current can give you the same results as working out with weights - a lower current equals less weight or crank up the speed for intense resistance.</p>
<p>One of the more attractive elements of a swim spa is the relatively low cost in comparison to a regular swimming pool A top of the range above ground swim spa will cost you between $15,000 and $30,000, although you can purchase a cheaper model for a much lower price than this. There have also been extensive studies done around the world on the health benefits of a swimming pool and spa. Have a look at our massive range of spa pools and contact us or your local spa shop to sit in some to see how they fit.</p>

Above ground hot tubs are freestanding basins that can be positioned anywhere, provided that there is connection to electric energy.</p>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things.
