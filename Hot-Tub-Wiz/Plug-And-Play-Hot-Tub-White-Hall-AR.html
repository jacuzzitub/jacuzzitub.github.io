<p>When you are looking for good swim spas, don't forget to have a look at the H2X. One of the biggest benefits of a swim spa is that it can be used 365 days a year. One downside is that you cannot use bubble bath, bath oil or bath salts in a jetted tub with water jets. That offers the user finger tip control of the swim current from inside the swim area. We will first take a look at the benefits the swim spa can bring, on the fitness and relaxation side of things. If you're pregnant or you have a health condition like heart disease, ask your doctor if it's safe for you to get into a hot tub.</p>
<p>If you're considering an online supplier, Google them to see what type of experiences other customers have had and remember that the cost of the swim spa itself will only be part of the overall cost including delivery, concrete base, fencing and certifier and permit fees. Besides the above there are a few other major differences that can be seen between the two, which we will now take a more in-depth look at, and also approach the benefits that a swim spa can bring.</p>

<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well. These centers usually have more than one pool which caters to guests of different swimming requirements. These bacteria are found naturally in water, and hot tubs that aren't disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella, according to the CDC.</p>
