<p>Spas and Hot tubs have enjoyed huge popularity of the last few years. People can ask the hot tub operator if the disinfectant and pH levels are checked at least twice a day. The need of Indian families for small spa with swimming facility was felt long so Arrdev have come up with swim spa which is suitable for the small space and can be accommodated in just 100 sqft (10 sqmeter). Clearwater Spas warrants their spa shell interior surface against blistering, cracking and delamination for 10 years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>Outdoor hot tubs also come in a variety of styles but are generally either a round or octagon shape. Most of these accidents happened at a pool or hot tub at the child's own home. At almost six metres in length and two and a half metres in width, the AquaSport 19 DTfX acts as a swimming pool, hot tub and aquafit centre all in a single unit. Unfortunately, there are a number of cons that come with having even a small Jacuzzi bathtub installed.</p>

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa.

The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
