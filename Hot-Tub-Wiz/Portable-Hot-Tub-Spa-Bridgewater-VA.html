<h3>Hot Tubs, Spas & Pools For Extreme Climates Bridgewater</h3>
<p>Arctic Spas® is an original member in good standing as a certified HotTubStar manufacturer. In fact you will find it purifying drinking water and public swimming pools all around the world. Created to improve the quality of life for you and your family and built to last a lifetime. The ideal place for Jacuzzi tubs is in the garden or patio where you have substantial foundations to rely on. To enable all year round use you can construct a gazebo or small room around it.

<p>This over-the-top hot tub gets better with luxury features like LED pop-up speakers for the built-in digital audio system, an aromatherapy canister for soothing scents and even a cascading waterfall. However, they are designed to be smaller than regular pools, as their primary function is relaxation, although the swim jets do enable you to swim effectively within the space. Sure it looks like fun seeing all of the foam that can result from hot water, jets and bubble bath, but it's a sorry mess to clean up. Typically it's best to drain the tub and start over with fresh water if bubble bath or high sudsing agents have been added to the hot tub either accidentally or as a prank.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>

You should always ensure that a heat pump is fitted to any swim spa or spa pool that you are considering purchasing. We start out with 12 ft swim spas and go up to 16 ft swim spa models.
