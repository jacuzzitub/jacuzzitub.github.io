<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>
<p>Drink water while in the hot tub to cool off your body. We also have many videos right here on our web site where you can see Swim Spas in action, right from your own computer screen. Relaxation is important during pregnancy, and since there are few better ways to relax, you may be tempted to swim in a swim spa or soak in a hot tub. This is the hot tub side of the spa. Watch Part Two of this brand new video from which takes you through the plumbing, jetting, insulating and cabinetry necessary for every hot tub spa or swim spa.</p>

<p>Finally, if you live in an area, which has hard water, then you will need to add an anti-scaling chemical to stop the build-up of calcium deposits on the sides and floor of your hot tub. The powerful jets enable you to swim in place just as you would in a regular pool or in the lake. Designed to improve your lifestyle and offer a better way of taking care of yourself, Jacuzzi® hot tubs are the most complete and versatile synthesis of shared well-being.</p>
<p>The water resistance available at swim spas can help you in burning more calories than doing the same workout on drylands, losing weight and fat mass, and improving your fitness level. As already mentioned, in addition to the standard equipment, hot tubs can be equipped with extra accessories like the devices for chromotherapy and aromatherapy. These are super-strong fibreglass pools with ceramic cores, manufactured to the very highest standards using the latest in swimming pool technology.</p>
<p>For the most part, swim spas costing between $10,000 and $20,000 are built with cost rather than quality in mind. Although it is small, at least compared to SwimEx's other spas, it's big enough to accommodate several people with enough room for all to exercise. Swim spas also provide something lap pools do not — hydro - massage in a comfortable hot tub setting. So one should carefully inspect the second hand hot tub shell closely for minute hairline stress cracks or perhaps gouges that may turn into cracks.</p>
<h3>Hot Tub Spas & Home Saunas Holtville</h3>
<p>At the time the manufacturers wanted to clearly differentiate themselves from the old-fashioned wooden barreled hot tubs so they started using the term spa” rather than hot tub as it described the hydrotherapy effects and captured the luxurious nature of the new product rather well. These centers usually have more than one pool which caters to guests of different swimming requirements. These bacteria are found naturally in water, and hot tubs that aren't disinfected properly can become contaminated with Legionella, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>As always when making a major purchase, however, it is essential to do your research and check that you are purchasing a good quality swim spa which will last a long time and be safe to use. Chlorine and bromine are both excellent sanitizers used in spas and hot tubs. Indoor hot tubs eliminate the awkwardness of using the tub in front of neighbors or passersby. Cushioned headrests, ergonomic seats, and a host of high-performance features make this the ultimate home spa experience.</p>
<p>One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>

Natural swimming pools attempt to duplicate the environment of natural swimmable lakes which are healthy, non-polluted and ecologically-balanced bodies of water. Nowadays, the one-piece hot tubs are also quite common and have many advantages as well.</p>

<p>Although the larger Jacuzzi family thought this idea was a little weird, the sales grew and soon the bathtub was designed to be a bit larger so as to fit in 2 people. In Jacuzzi an electric heater can be installed to enjoy hot whirling water. Residential or home pools are sometimes built-in or assembled above ground. Many dealerships now display Swim Spas in their stores. We design and manufacture our own hot tubs for public and private use, for indoor or outdoor installation, for frequent or occasional use and for relaxing or to supplement your fitness regime.</p>
