Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
