<p>Hot tubs have become common features of health clubs, gyms and even homes. Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub. Producing a steady, smooth current, single-shell models from Endless Pool Fitness Systems are perfect for those who enjoy total-body aquatic activity and complete relaxation.</p>

Many people do not realize how dangerous it can be to ignore this crucial swimming gear. Even if you don't have a regular recreational pool, make sure there isn't anything enticing left around your swim spa or hot tub. The best thing about a Swim Spa is that it eliminates the need for a full-sized swimming pool and a spa and thus cuts back on the amount of space needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we get calls all the time from people who bought from one of these traveling hot tub shows complaining that they can't get help. This is why most people have their swim spa above ground and consider building steps or a deck around it if they want a more landscaped look. In fact, even man's best friend, his dog, can benefit from quality time spent in a swimming pool and spa. Lidos, ocean pools, in Australia were created by enclosing a section of the rock shelf where water circulates through the pools or by constant flooding over the side of the pool during high tide.</p>

Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home. With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
<p>In general, swim spas tend to cost more than hot tubs of comparable size, although that varies depending on such things as the number of jets and other amenities. Some love the flexibility that a swim spa provides, while others are after the many features they offer. If you want to feel relaxed by pleasuring in the warm waters after an entire day of work, then you should install Jacuzzi in your bathroom to feel completely relaxed.</p>
<p>Another advantage of portable hot tubs are they can be looked after much better, lets just say that you were having a terrible winter, with a normal hot tub you would only be able to cover the tub which would ultimately still lead to wear and tear throughout the year. Soaking in your hot tub can be a true panacea for your health. Swim spas have this feature wherein you can swim in place for as long as you want.</p>
