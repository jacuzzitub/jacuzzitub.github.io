<p>The popularity of condo hot tubs is very much on the rise. However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>
<p>Hot tubs are becoming very popular due to their many benefits. Don't jump straight from the hot tub into the pool to cool off. The tub will have a wooden seat or bench running around the walls, so that it's easy for people to sit down and relax. Hydrotherapy is a treatment you can avail of in a hot tub for relaxation with the combination of heat, massage and buoyancy. For that reason, most people have no idea what a swim spa really costs.</p>

<p>This can range from large, spa pools which you might find in a leisure centre or health club, to private whirlpool baths for domestic properties. Now the price of a Swim Spa seems very reasonable when compared to a $16,000 hot tub or a $40,000 inground pool. For all swim spas, be sure to maintain a chlorine level of about 1.0 - 2.0 ppm or if using bromine, 2.0 - 4.0 ppm. Meanwhile, the permanent hydrotherapy pools in the spas became known as spas or spa pools themselves just to make life a little more complicated.</p>
<p>The idea is that you swim in the tub and the current produced by the swim spa pushes against you in much the same way as a treadmill. Putting one on the second floor is not a good idea, unless it is a small bathtub Jacuzzi. Our insulation system harnesses all the heat from the pumps and the heater inside the spa cabinet while reflecting the colder outside air away from the spa. This is why we make Royal Spa Swim Spas from components that can be found at most pool and spa supply stores.</p>
<p>Each of our specially-designed family of hot tubs offers its own unique look, feel and features so you can find the right fit for you and your entire family. As with hot tubs, start your sauna search by identifying how many people will be using it at one time. Since you will be receiving a new Jacuzzi® Brand hot tub once every three years you can forget worrying about your warranty expiring or what it covers.</p>
