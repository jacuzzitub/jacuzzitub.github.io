<p>You will find that there are many manufacturers of bath tubs on the market today but only one name really stands above the rest. We'll describe the average swim spa and compare that with both of the largest Hydropool models in the article below. Like all swimming pools, swim spa pools are available in a range of different sizes and shapes. The jets force out water into various points in the spa.
