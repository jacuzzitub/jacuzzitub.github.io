<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>

<p>Keep young children away from spas or hot tubs unless there is constant adult supervision. The food coloring will not damage any of the components in your hot tub, but you will have to drain it afterwards and refill it with fresh water. Of course, the Fastlane Pools Fitness System is so much more than a swim spa. There is a new invention called a Fast Lane Swim Jet unit that can be been retrofitted into most existing swimming pools.</p>

A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>
<p>The areas around the pump and tubes need clearance as well in case any repairs are needed down the line. If the pH level becomes too low, the water will become acidic, irritating the skin of swimmers and causing corrosive damage to your spa or pool. All Jacuzzi® Hot Tubs have a five stage filtration and ClearRay bulb, ensuring your water is quickly and easily cleared of all debris ready for use. In total, there are 14 swim spas to pick from - that's the largest selection of the companies we reviewed, matched only by Hydropool's inventory.</p>
