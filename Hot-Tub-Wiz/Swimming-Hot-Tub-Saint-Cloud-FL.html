<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Hot tubs and swim spas are both significant investments and both can benefit your physical and mental health as well as your social life. Spa hot tubs are designed in collaboration with physiotherapists in order to enable the final clients to enjoy the advantages of hydromassage. Tom Lachocki, PhD, CEO of the US national Swimming Pool Foundation. If you decide to use a hot tub during pregnancy, take precautions and make sure you soak for a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>

Look for a swim spa that insulates both the water in the swim spa and the outer cabinet.</p>
<p>One stays cool for swimming, and the other stays hot for hot tubbing. For this reason, Vortex Spas use a 4 layer, 8 step Thermabond lamination process not found in most swim spas.

We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
