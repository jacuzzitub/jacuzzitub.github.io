<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>The most prominent safety feature walk-in tubs bring to the table — the door — also has a downside because you can't fill the tub with water before entering it, which could leave you a bit chilled. Hot tubs offer rest and relaxation. Swim spas are perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy, low-impact way to exercise on a daily basis. And just like its namesake, great performance is exactly what you'll experience with the Michael Phelps Legend Series hot tub.</p>

<p>Lastly, Jacuzzi tubs are the perfect accessory to relax sore muscles and relieve joint pain. Currently, Jacuzzi is the world's most recognized whirl pool brand name. Not only does a Vortex Swim Spa have less water to heat, but when combined with our Vortex Hybrid Heat Pump it's the most cost effective heated swimming pool option. Hot Springs Resort & Spa is excited to announce our Signature Tub Series. Something that many people don't realize, is that that the more they use their spas, the more they can save.</p>
<p>At that point in time, the Swim Spa did not really seem like such a great bargain. We have a large variety of hot tubs for sale. Some people prefer water temperatures to be at about body temperature of about 98.6. When someone who reacts badly to very hot water gets in a too hot spa they may have a heat stroke. You can find the same benefits of hot tubs in swim spas. Finding the best hot tubs for sale doesn't have to be difficult.</p>
<p>The air jets on a Spa system will be on the bottom of your bath. Hot tubs are available with both cottages holidays, and lodge holidays. Forget about the anxiety of public pools, the drive to fancy spas to pamper yourself, or searching for physical therapy centers. Sometimes all the water jets may automatically move or rotate, again providing the effect of a massage. Warm water is known to soothe muscles. A pump with a higher horsepower is going to cost you more - so make sure that you understand how much force you need to apply to suck the water in. This will depend upon two factors - the general water pressure in your area and the size of the hot tub that you want to fill.</p>

Jacuzzi AccuPro jets are the building blocks for Jacuzzi's Whirlpool tub, and send out a precise, pinpointed flow of water and air to target specific trouble spots on the user's body.</p>
<p>Ask any family with a Vortex Swim Spa and they will tell you the kids absolutely LOVE THEM. From the jetted seats to do a massage for your muscles, the dual zone with hot and cold water, and the temperature control panels to offer a great healing experience for tore muscles, pains, and cramps. By producing a continuous current, swim spa water pressure encourages continuous swimming motion, producing a more effective exercise regimen.</p>
