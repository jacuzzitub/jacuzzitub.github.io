<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>

Make sure when you drain and refill your tub that you use a true spa cleaning solution and let the jets run for 20-30 minutes, if not longer, before draining.
