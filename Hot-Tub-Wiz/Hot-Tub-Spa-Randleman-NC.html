<p>That wonderful feeling you get whenever you sit back in a hot tub is because of the way your body reacts to the heat and jets of water.

<p>If the hot tub freezes or is damaged due to maintenance issues, count on any claim you put in being denied regardless of how your specific policy handles hot tubs. The Michael Phelps Signature Series Swim Spas by Master Spas, provide an unmatched experience. However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo.

<p>Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>The reason most people opt for a swim spa is that they don't have enough room for a full-sized swimming pool. The swimming part of a swim spa is what makes it uniquely different than a hot tub alone, however. Always make certain the spa's control system accommodates the heat pump. And if you're interested in swimming laps without installing a massive pool, swim spas are a great alternative. As we evaluated them, we considered their current systems and the types of jets they offer as well as their customer service, selection, prices and accessories.</p>
