<p>Many people use the word Jacuzzi to describe a hot tub or spa, but in fact they are incorrect as Jacuzzi is a brand name. Exercise isn't the only pastime when there's a swim spa at home. With all commercial hot tubs found in hotels, gyms and health clubs they are mandatory to list the full set of safely points next to the hot tubs for all users to read.

It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
