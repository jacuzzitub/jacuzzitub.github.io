<p>A guy named Dr. Stephen Blair (University of South Carolina) conducted an extended survey to study the effectiveness of swimming for fitness. In 1956, the Jacuzzi family created a portable hydrotherapy pump to help treat a family member's painful arthritis. This creates a stronger massage than tubs with the air jets. Equipped with classic filtration systems and just one or two pumps depending on the model, these J-200 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are among Jacuzzi's most affordable models. Swim spas are flexible, durable and practical. In just a few years' time, Jacuzzi became a household name and was quickly used to refer to any and all hot tubs, however incorrectly.</p>
<p>Affordable to buy and to operate, J-300 Jacuzzi® hot tubs are available in several different sizes and configurations. Before you buy a hot tub for your backyard or step into those warm waters at the spa or gym, make sure you know a bit about their safety. Many of our showrooms have a swim spas on the floor that you can sit in to get an idea of the size but if you let us know in advance we can fill one up with water to try out the jets as well.</p>

<p>Neither of these options add major benefits to your overall spa experience. Many people do jogging and running exercises, but swimming is a popular alternative for those who either don't enjoy running or might have joint issues, as exercising in water produces less stress on your legs and joints. Whether you're treating a health problem or simply relaxing in the hot waters of our natural mineral baths, the health-giving properties of this resort's hot mineral waters have been famous since 1778.</p>
<p>Today Jacuzzis are normally found in residential homes, hotels suites, aboard cruise ships, and in the spas sprinkled in all parts of the world. The intensity and direction of the hydromassages, the water temperature regulation and the jets number are managed through a digital control board for the hydrotherapy to be efficient. You want the very latest in design whereby the Jets provide a vigorous massage to loosen those tight knotted muscles and at the same time increase the blood and oxygen circulation which helps to bring nutrients to sore muscles and joints.</p>
<p>Hot tubs or spas are typically set to around 40°c - although this can be lowered if you find you find that 40°c is a little too hot for you. Sedona Spas fabricates all of our own spa shells in house, this allows us to ensure the utmost quality in production as well as offer our own brand of unique design. The hot tubs on today's market have a pump that circulates the water through pipes and then out of underwater Venturi jets.</p>
