<p>The Balboa Water Group is widely known for its lines of equipment, accessories and control system for the leisure water industry. In a Whirlpool bath you can direct the jets to specific muscles in your leg or back or wherever you're feeling tight.

In the event of an injury, soaking in a hot tub may reduce recovery time since the increased blood circulation is bringing more blood to the injured area, resulting in faster healing.</p>
<p>The hot tub bacterium that causes the skin condition thrives in the contaminated water. Don't be fooled by the black-and-white color scheme of this hot tub - it's the gold standard of acrylic hot tubs from the experts at Canadian Spa. Jacuzzi doesn't mention warranties for their walk-in tubs specifically on their website, but for reference, their whirlpool tubs come with a limited lifetime warranty. Swim spas as typically smaller than lap pools, but offer varied jet speeds and intensity for a customized swim workout that changes as skills improve.</p>

<p>Modern hot tubs are very different to the traditional variety.

Swim spas are hybrid hot tubs.</p>

One of the top concerns when dealing with a Jacuzzi bathtub is the growth of bacteria and mold within the jets and tubing. Bring along somebody who already has a Hot Tub or has experience of using a hot tub if you are at all unsure of what you should be looking for when evaluating the possible purchase.</p>
