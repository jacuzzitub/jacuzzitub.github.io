<p>Properly made and designed Hot Tubs should have the very latest ideas in design and in this article I set out a couple of points that need to be taken into account when you are choosing a Hot Tub that is namely Energy Conservation Systems and Manifold Plumbing. Traditionally the water in a hot tub is still, just like a swimming pool, and would only be circulated to heat filter it. Chlorine and disinfectants are used to maintain the hot tub.

Swim spas usually only have seating at one end with 2 or 4 powerful swim jets at the other. If you're thinking about investing in a swim spa, you're probably interested in its health and exercise benefits. The water is hot and the jets are powerful which I find amazing for a 110 V appliance.</p>
