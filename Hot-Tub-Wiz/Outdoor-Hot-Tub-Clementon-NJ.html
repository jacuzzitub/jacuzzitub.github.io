<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>Cedar Mountain Spa Covers prides itself on quality. Yep, you can try out one of our hot tubs for as long as you like.

You can eventually have your own swimming spa in front of your house. Hot tubs are said to work therapeutically. The best swim spas are designed so you swim in place against a current, rather than swimming traditional lengths in a pool.</p>
