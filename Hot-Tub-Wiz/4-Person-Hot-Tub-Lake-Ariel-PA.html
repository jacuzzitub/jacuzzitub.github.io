<p>When considering the purchase of a hot tub, the price is not the only factor that you should take into consideration. After a long day, relaxing in the luxurious heat of your outdoor hot tub is just what you need to rejuvenate your mind and restore your body. Also the green view is one that is very much listened to by the hot tub industry resulting in much more ecological friendly Hot Tubs. By using a swim spa regularly you will get fit and toned by swimming. In 1990, Roy Jacuzzi® was placed in the National Kitchen and Bath Hall of Fame in the USA, recognising him for his many contributions in the innovation of hydrotherapy for home use.</p>

<p>Jacuzzi bathtubs are considered a luxury and not something found in the average home. So, let's take a look at what's so great about these two hot tub brands. Just like hot tub spas, most Swim Spas are molded out of acrylic and are typically 12' - 24' in length. It is also worth inquiring on what type of insulation they have as some cheap hot tub will have none, and therefore cost more to run but some other cheap hot tubs are well insulated and will be cheaper to run.</p>
<p>Master Spas' patented EcoPur® Charge Water Filtration System minimizes maintenance while providing crystal clear water. For example, the first time you use your new tub and try to remove its bulky 7'x7' cover, you will quickly understand the value of a hydraulic cover lifter: a device that makes it a breeze to open and close your cover. There are hot tubs made for only one, and they go up in size from there. The word spa refers to a tub filled with water that has heat for the water and jets to spray the water and circulate it throughout the tub.</p>
<p>Mid-tier hot tubs are between the $5000 to $8000 mark and the luxury price bracket is from $9000 upwards. The Swim Spa to the left is made out of Fiberglass Composite by SwimEx These type of Swim Spas can be ordered as completed units or come in sections to be assembled on-site for easy access. Experience Clearwater Spas' Exclusive Patent-Pending Complete Water Purification System. Other Jacuzzi bathtubs require water to be present in the tub when the jets are on. Thankfully, homeowners can buy different chemical cleaners to help keep their tubing clean.</p>
