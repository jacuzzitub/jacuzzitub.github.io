<p>The hot tub bacterium that causes the skin condition thrives in the contaminated water. Don't be fooled by the black-and-white color scheme of this hot tub - it's the gold standard of acrylic hot tubs from the experts at Canadian Spa. Jacuzzi doesn't mention warranties for their walk-in tubs specifically on their website, but for reference, their whirlpool tubs come with a limited lifetime warranty.

<p>These help to make your workout more intensive by offering more resistance in the water, so you are basically swimming the equivalent of a long distance within a relatively small space.
