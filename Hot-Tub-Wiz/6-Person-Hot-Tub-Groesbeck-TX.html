<p>While it is rather unfortunate, from time to time your hot tub may have a leak in it. Thankfully, there are some easy methods that you can implement that allow you to locate the leak and have it fixed. Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia.
