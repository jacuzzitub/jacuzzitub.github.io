<h3>Spas Hot Tubs Bend OR 97701</h3>
<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of luxury you're going for you can get hot tubs with different jet speeds, mood lighting and even built in sound systems so you can really make the most of your outdoor space. This acrylic bathtub is extensively used at homes, hotels and many other places. On average, a Jacuzzi tub weighs 700 Lbs, and once you add water and your body weight into the equation, the entire setup can weigh up to 1,000 Lbs.</p>
<p>Experimental men have been known to get a bit aggressive with whirlpool jets, and some men have been caught with their delicate parts entrapped. As swim spas are relatively compact, they can be a good solution if you do not have a lot of space in your backyard. Recently our local factory warehouse ran a newspaper ad and featured a hot tub on sale for $750. Soak in the hot water and it will naturally pull out toxins and excess water from your body.</p>
