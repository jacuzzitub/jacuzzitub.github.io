<p>Swimming pools definitely add beauty and value to one's home - but they are also major energy users. Our Swim Spas combine the fun of a full-sized pool with the therapeutic and relaxation benefits of a hot tub. A trademark for a whirlpool bath or a device that swirls water in a bath. The spa is attached to the pool and has heated water while the pool is a larger area to allow for swimming and exercise. From improved sleep patterns and reduced stress, to eased muscle tension, soothed joints, and so much more - the installation of a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub can transform your lifestyle in so many wonderful ways.</p>
<p>If you are looking to have a swimming pool and hot tub combination, a two tank swim spa might be your best option. Swim spas require a solid, level surface to sit on and an electrical supply line (usually 220 volt, similar to a hot tub). We believe the best way to deliver great service is to represent the number 1 hot tub brand in the world - Jacuzzi. In fact, some studies suggest aquatic exercise may be more effective than on-land workouts for some people with back ailments, according to an article by Rena Goldman in Pool & Spa News Like with osteoarthritis and bone and joints ailments, the secret here lies in the reduction of pressure on your joints provided by the buoyancy of the water.</p>
<h2>2 Person Hot Tub Eaton Colorado</h2>
<p>Our beautiful LED lighting and water features will give those curious and playful minds a healthy outlet, and will build an appreciation for taking time for relaxation. Take your rejuvenating swim hat is available within just a few steps away from you without all the worries many who go for pools suffer from. Now that's not to say that your hot tub might not be a Jacuzzi brand or it might even be sold by a company who refers to spas or has the word spa” in their name.</p>
<p>The hot water afterward will release the tension in your muscles from your workouts which gives you the perfect combination for a better environment to increase your exercise quality. We are your spa, hot tub and swim spa specialist. If you're looking for more of a massage to the muscles, then a whirlpool system is a better choice.

<h3>Swim Spas & Fitness Pools Eaton</h3>
<p>Imagine the luxury of being able to swim laps from your very own swimming pool at home. If the Paris hot tub is just a tad out of your price range, then you can still reap all the benefits of a Lay-Z-Spa with the Miami hot tub. Hot tubs are sometimes also known as spas, or by the trade name Jacuzzi. Some Swim Spa units are separated into two distinct bodies of water. Weight loss spas, swim spas or beauty spas indulge and pamper yourself all the way to the glory.</p>
<p>Swim spas can often be used like regular hot tubs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that becoming overheated in a hot tub is not recommended during pregnancy. If a swim spa isn't quite what you're looking for, there are a wide range of alternatives to swim spas in Australia. When it comes to setting standards for swim spa covers, the Smartop Vanish Swim Spa Cover (XTST113) sets the bar high.</p>
<p>The most difficult part about an inflatable hot tub is the inflation of it - and that's not too difficult or time consuming with an air pump. With several sizes to choose from, an Endless Pools Swim Spa can fit virtually anywhere. Clearwater Spas cover lift makes it easier to remove your hot tub hardcover. So, my best advice, is that one should only buy a product that is well built by an American or Western internationally recognized producer of Hot Tubs and then there is every chance that the product will last and last and give very many years of faultless performance.</p>
<p>3. Programmable circulation pumps-This system is larger and has the option to be time programmed on how long you want it to run for, dependable on how often your spa is being used meaning they are energy efficient. Beside the obvious benefits of using spa covers which will help keep your spa clean and safe to use, your spa tub also can also affect your body's blood and blood vessels in different beneficial ways.</p>
<h3>Spas And Hot Tubs Eaton CO 80615</h3>
<p>Some of our swim spas have seating along the sides of the spa as well like myLapswim This gives more room for people to sit and enjoy a massage but reduces the pool area at the swim jet end. Most Fantasy hot tubs are plug-n-play for easy installation and operation. Two-in-one swim spa design combines a swim current with hydro massage luxury. Aqua Spas offers both the Michael Phelps and H2X series from Master Spas, giving you top-of-the-line swim spas to choose from.</p>
<p>Therefore, to enjoy your jacuzzi tub safely without any fear of electrical hazards, you should hire the services of an experienced electrical contractor for installing a hot tub and circuit breaker. Keep in mind your intended use before you spend the money on a spa or hot tub. This is great news for Orange County swimmers and fitness enthusiasts who are seeking to get their swim on, in a strong current. To prevent hot tub rash, the CDC recommends showering with soap and cleaning your swimsuit after getting out of the water.</p>
<p>Experimental men have been known to get a bit aggressive with whirlpool jets, and some men have been caught with their delicate parts entrapped. As swim spas are relatively compact, they can be a good solution if you do not have a lot of space in your backyard. Recently our local factory warehouse ran a newspaper ad and featured a hot tub on sale for $750. Soak in the hot water and it will naturally pull out toxins and excess water from your body.</p>
