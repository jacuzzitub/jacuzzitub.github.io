<p>We all know that spas and hot tubs have been around for numerous amounts of years, this being said the old economical spas always had there setbacks. Built with strong and durable materials, Jacuzzi spas will operate at a consistently high level, assuring you reliable, energy-efficient performance for years of worry-free hot tub enjoyment.

<p>The warm water inside the tub can relax spasms, alleviate sprains, backache, and fatigue. This allow you to run your heat pump from your spa controller (not via a separate touchpad), use both heat pump AND electric heater for extra fast heating and extends the life of the heat pump. The heat eases out the tension built up in the muscles and increases the blood flow, which in turn heals the body.

The Athabascan Swim Spa is an all-weather pool with quite a bit of swimming area in its 1,347 gallons of water. Parts like pumps, swim jets and current diverters are made specifically with swimming in mind and deliver a much better experience than low-end swim spas that only use hot tub parts.</p>
<p>Their filtration systems are also made for hot tubs and are not designed to efficiently clean the amount of water found in a swim spa. Swim Spas provide the absolute best swimming exercise work out, using the least amount of space in your home or yard. By incorporating body jets into the sides of the tub, it became the bath that almost single-handedly created an industry. Another thing to remember if you are thinking of buying an indoor hot tub is that, although they are more convenient, indoor hot tubs require more complex installations than traditional outdoor ones.</p>
