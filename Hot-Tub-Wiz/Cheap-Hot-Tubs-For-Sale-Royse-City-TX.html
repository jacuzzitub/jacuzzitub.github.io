Similar to a regular bathtub you would see in a home, these hot tubs, sometimes called whirlpool baths or Jacuzzis, are filled with water for each use than drained when your soaking is complete.</p>
<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>

They say that swimmers are more prone to dehydration because it causes high levels of exertion in the body, but swimmers do not feel the urge to drink because they are immersed within the water and therefore the brain is not aware of the need for water, and other liquids.</p>
<p>Approved safety locks - A quality approved locking cover is just as accepted as a fully fenced spa pool. Since every policy is a little different in their treatment of hot tubs, make sure you check with your insurance provider or read your policy to make sure you understand the specifics of your coverage. It might even be called a spa as in the Lay zee spa brand in the UK, but, if it's freestanding, semi-permanent and has inbuilt filtration and heating then it's a hot tub.</p>
