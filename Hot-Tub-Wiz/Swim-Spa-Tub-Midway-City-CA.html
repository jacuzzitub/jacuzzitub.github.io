The J-500 Collection Combining innovative technology, ground-breaking design and legendary Jacuzzi® hydromassage, The J-500® Collection establishes a new standard in backyard luxury. Your time with us in the Canberra show room was not only educational to operating a spa, but also the benefits in purchasing a Spa World spa.

First, by insulating the cabinet instead of the shell, Vortex spas recycles lost heat from the pumps and equipment, it also insulates the plumbing that would otherwise lose heat to the environment.

<p>And while a number of studies have touted the benefits of swimming over every other form of exercise (including jogging and walking!), and include swimming as a recommended form of exercise for everything from increasing the chances of conception in women to easing the suffering of those with Fibromyalgia, very few insurance plans offer any sort of coverage or assistance when making the purchase of a swimming spa.</p>
