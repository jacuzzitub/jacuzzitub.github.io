<p>As inviting and innocuous-looking as your Jacuzzi or hot tub may seem, using it for therapeutic purposes will require more precaution than you probably expect. If you are planning to heat your swim spa for some or all of the year the best way to do this is with a heat pump which can heat (and potentially cool) your spa - providing total control over the water temperature for under $10 a week. It's important to note that some insurance providers simply won't cover you with the additional risk that a hot tub introduces. We recommend that you consult a plumber to calculate precisely what size water heater you'll need for a walk-in tub so you won't shortchange the rest of your household while bathing.</p>
<p>Thanks to the MP line, you can enjoy full-body effects of aquatic exercise with time saving convenience in the privacy of your own home. A backlit buoyancy jet helps maintain ideal swimming position while stabilizing hip jets ensures the swimmer remains centered in the swim lane. Although, hot tubs and spas are convenient to use, they have a shortcoming associated with them also. If your hot tub pump seal is leaking, you will need to find the correct seal kit.</p>

A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, Jacuzzi® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>By choosing a swim spa, you can swim without doing laps in a regular sized pool. Hot tubs can replace what used to happen nightly at the dinner table. The benefits of using jetted bathtubs should never be underestimated. Swim spas would waste a single penny of yours. Swim spas tend to have large seating areas, as they are primarily used for relaxation rather than swimming. This has added jets that release high pressure water, making you feel like you are swimming against the current.</p>

However, when you use both a spa and a swimming pool, the possibilities and benefits are endless.</p>
<p>Although in the water, swimming is a strenuous sport that can induce dehydration - especially when one is swimming for long periods of time. They are ideal as individual features, as part of your spa area, or alongside a sauna, steam room or pool. At the same time, in the water, you have an extra resistance to move against which gives you the ultimate benefits of your workout sessions without even sensing it. Letting your mind go without any worries is mentally comforting to get the maximum workout experience.</p>
