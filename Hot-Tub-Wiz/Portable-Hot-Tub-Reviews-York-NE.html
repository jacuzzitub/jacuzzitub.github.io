<p>Swim spas definitely are not cheap, but they are about half the price of a nice pool. In pools, you worry about turns, running into the wall, or jumping too deep that you hit the ground, swim spas erase these concerns and the possibility of these incidents. Jacuzzi is the company that brought hydrotherapy to the market more than 50 years ago with their hot tubs, and it is clear they are the leading experts in the industry.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the plethora of hot tub accessories available on Wayfair that will only add to your hot tub experience. The faster the filters can clean the water , the less the swim spa will need to run when you're not using it. We liked the hard top cover and simplicity of the Eco Spas. Even though the current is strong, it will never come between you and your swim laps and workouts due to the consistency of the water flow that will never let you hit the end of the spa.</p>
<p>The risks involved highlight the importance of using the correct chemical products for your pool and swim spa. Gone are the days where hot tubs are placed in one spot and stay there indefinitely. You should also remove and clean the Hot Tubs filter thoroughly making sure you remove any contamination.

Aquatic Circuit Training in a swimspa increases your aerobic and strength levels and burns more calories than other forms of exercise.</p>
