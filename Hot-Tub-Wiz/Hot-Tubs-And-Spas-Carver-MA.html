<p>They find SwimLife swimspas the ultimate answer to satify all their needs and answer the demand for more for their money. SwimLife is all about changing how the industry sells and promotes swimspas. A sauna bath feels therapeutic, but may be a bit too warm for the testicles, and men who regularly spend time in hot tubs may have low fertility rates as a result. Cheaper spas sometimes reduce the size of the unit to make up for these cuts.</p>
