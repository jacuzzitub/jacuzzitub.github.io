<p>Many people dream of installing a swimming pool in their backyards. Unlike a swimming pool, there is no requirement to excavate your backyard. It was one of those gazebo hot tubs set up in the back yard and I was really pleasantly surprised to come across a jacuzzi. That's why swim spas are definitely cheaper when it comes to their initial cost. Though the J-200 collection features entry-level pricing, these Jacuzzi® hot tubs are packed with features including CLEARRAY® water purification, numerous jets, and spacious designs.</p>
<p>Great for aching muscles or a sore back, the calming heat of a spa combined with jets for massage is the cure to any bad week. The ALL NEW Premium swim spa line was created to improve the quality of life for you and your family. Perimeter lighting with 15-20 single LED's around the water line of the spa or swim spa. Here we take a look at the swim spa in detail, and answer all your questions so you can make an informed decision about the best pool type for you.</p>

<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms.
