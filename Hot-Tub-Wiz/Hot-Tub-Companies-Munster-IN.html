<p>Take your soaking experience to the next level by adding Jacuzzi® Epsom Salt to your bathing ritual. Some swimming pool cleaning services experts recommend reducing pump operation to one hour per day until normal filtration cycle time is reached. Swim, exercise and relax with friends and family from the comforts and convenience of home. With multiple pumps you also get more and stronger massage jets as you can divert the water from the swim jets to the massage seats when you are not swimming.</p>
<p>This is a very popular option for people who have small water heaters or wish to install an outdoor Jacuzzi Instead of completely draining your household water heater to fill up the Jacuzzi tub, you can use cooler water and let the independent heating system kick in.
