You may have heard others call this a swim spa,” but we know a fitness system is so much more.</p>
<h3>Why Choose Swim Spas Over Hot Tubs Castleton On Hudson</h3>
<p>Other things to consider when thinking about adding a spa to your home are things like where is the water supply coming from, how heavy will it be and can it be supported, and also you need to take into consideration how many people may be using it. Now although you will probably have a fitter work everything out for you, make sure you question the plans as regards to any electrics and water supplies, so that you are clear in your own head that what they are suggesting can not only be implemented, but are also safe.</p>
<p>With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>These hot tubs are sometimes called Jacuzzi or Whirlpool tubs, though these are actually brand names. Leisurescape Pools & Spas stock a great variety of swim spas. A hot tub pump is made up of two sections. Two 5hp SwimBoost Pumps producing up to 360 gallons per minute per jets and one 3hp Buoyancy Pump. It's easy to set up and features a rapid heating system, which will heat the water to a toasty 40-degrees centigrade (or less, if you desire).</p>
<p>Your skin and muscles loosen and relax from the increased blood circulation.” Keep yourself in good condition by using your hot tub in Ironwood both before and after you exercise. Some Jacuzzi bathtubs have the ability to run even when there is no water in the tub. In addition, there are any physical health benefits to using a hot tub. Clearwater Spas prides itself in producing no VOC's (Volatile Organic Compound) that pollute the atmosphere.</p>

<p>You can even get the Swim Spa, which seats around five to seven people. Some Swim Spas are constructed with fiberglass composite similar to the hull of a boat. We offer only wood-fired hot tubs. Whether you're looking for a large hot tub to entertain friends and family during get-togethers or are looking for something for personal and compact, we have what you need. Shopping for a hot tub should be an easy experience.</p>
<p>This spinning wheel has indentations that move water through the pump and create the pressure in the pipes needed to keep water circulating and moving through the spa plumbing. Swim spas have one amazing addition that traditional swimming pools lack—the hydrotherapeutic experience. You can program a customized swimming experience to suit individual preferences, monitor your progress, and swim whenever you like in the comfort of your own home.</p>
