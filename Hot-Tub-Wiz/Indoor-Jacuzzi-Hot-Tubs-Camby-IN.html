<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>You are going to want to invest a bit of energy in putting it away where it is free from accumulation of dust and particles so that you experience a more comfortable spa session each time you use it. The number of motors and pumps is in direct relation to the actual size of the Hot Tub the number of jets and the degree of therapy delivered. Hydrotherapy is a therapeutic whole-body treatment that involves moving and exercising in water; essentially physiotherapy in a pool.</p>

<p>Indoor tubs may produce some moisture when in use, particularly if the ambient room temperature is much less than the water inside the vessel (hot tub water temperatures range from 100-104 degrees F). Those planning an indoor installation need to think about how long they'll use it and perhaps consider installing an exhaust fan to pull moisture from the room. The water inside a swim spa can provide a much more comfortable and enjoyable environment for low-impact exercise.</p>
<p>Browse other J-300 models to experience additional spas with more jets or smaller tubs. Some swim spas, which are usually small in size, are not heated as much as hot tubs. From the perfect placement of PowerPro® Jets to the optimal positioning of the body in ergonomic seats, a Jacuzzi® Hot Tub delivers the ultimate hydrotherapy massage. Shopping for a hot tub or sauna can be a daunting task — especially if you haven't shopped for one before.</p>
<p>A question we see often is, "How much do swim spas cost?" While there are many different price points to fit a wide range of budgets, it's important to note that a typical swim spa costs half that of a traditional swimming pool. Some hot tubs can be as hot as 40C, so it's best to avoid them. But the first thing to consider when choosing your hot tubs would be the location. Hot tubs today are used to alleviate stress and aid sleep.</p>
