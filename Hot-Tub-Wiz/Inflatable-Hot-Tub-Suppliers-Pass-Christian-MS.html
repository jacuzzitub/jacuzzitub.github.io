<p>Hot tubs come in various sizes ranging from the cute, two person "Soft Tub" to the very large multiple person party units. Your swim spa should be heat pump ready” and you should try and buy a swim spa with a heat pump compatible controller. In a Swim Spa, you are swimming in place as water rushes past you causing a loss of buoyancy that would be normally produced as you pull yourself up and over static water with every stroke. This then pairs with a bigger pump which is in charge of fueling the spas jets. They then managed to create a swimming spa which is more convenient to use compared to outdoor activities.</p>
<p>When shopping for coverage, be sure that you mention the hot tub to make sure a provider will cover a property with a hot tub. For all swimming pools, insert removable skimmer baskets to catch large debris before entering into the filtration system. When this is done it takes forever for the tub to warm up due to very little amount of power flowing through the heating elements, I do not recommend this way of installation for the large units.</p>
