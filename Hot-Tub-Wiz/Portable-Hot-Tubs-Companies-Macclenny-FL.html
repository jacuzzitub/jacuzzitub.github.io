<p>Many different styles of corner tubs are available, including taller and deeper tubs (much like soaking tubs) give you a full body bath in a quarter of the space (length x width), and it utilizes the often ample space in height in many bathrooms.

<p>The deep penetrating moist heat relaxes the muscles and expands the blood vessels, creating a sedative effect on the nervous system. Hydrotherapy in a hot tub provides relief for high blood pressure because it dilates or opens up blood vessels so the heart doesn't have to pump as hard.

<p>Your hot tub will have jets and blowers, which can be switch on or off, depending on how you feel. Just like our large range of spas , our selection of swim spa options spans all budgets and specifications. In the 1940s hot tubs began to appear in the USA, inspired by the Japanese ofuro Hydrotherapy pumps were introduced by Jacuzzi Fiberglass shell hot tubs appeared around 1970 and were soon superseded by cast acrylic shells.</p>
<p>Some cheaper swim spas offer long warranties that look good on paper but only actually cover parts. In a series of different studies done, it has also been found that swimming is one of the better forms of exercise you can undertake if you suffer from Fibromyalgia which is a fairly common condition in which a person suffers from pain and tenderness in muscles, tendons and joints, and has been linked to chronic headaches, sleep problems, and general fatigue.</p>
<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses. I know that sounds obvious, but many people dont consider the consequences of putting a hot tub inside the house, upstairs or even in the basement. When you sit in a tub of hot water, you receive health benefits through passive heating. Most standard-size swim spas can't fit through doors and are often too wide to be moved around the side of a home.</p>
