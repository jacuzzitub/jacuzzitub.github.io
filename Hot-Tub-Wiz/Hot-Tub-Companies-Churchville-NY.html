<p>Professional athletes usually have access to the latest techniques and methods of healing the stress and strains that are put on their bodies from the sports that they play. This pool's small size means less water and less water means smaller heating costs and fewer chemicals - a savings on both time and money. Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
<p>In case you need something much bigger, SwimEx makes the 1000 S - a multi-user swim spa that holds 7,700 gallons of water. Besides the usual Jacuzzi jets of water, the entire pool looked like the wake of the QE2. If you are looking for the best quality hot tub for your family, Jacuzzi is the brand for you.

<p>Of course, every Endless Pools Fitness System is so much more than a spa. Most of the hot tubs especially cheap imports from the east of the world are created using cheap methods, from people that probably have no expertise in the trade and are just following regular instructions from there team managers. Swimming pools make a great sand-less alternative, but laps in a public pool aren't always possible, and, of course, not private, and installing and maintaining your own pool may be too costly, not to mention the fact that you can't take it with you if you move or you may simply not have the space to accommodate one.</p>
<p>The drastic price difference while having the same benefits give swim spas an advantage over the other options. There are Hot tub on the marketplace now that are designed for two people only; therefore the tubs are much smaller to the traditional larger hot tubs.
