Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas.

The dealer from whom you are buying the hot tubs must have all the information related to the maintenance. Swim spas are mostly shaped like a traditional swimming pool, but they also include jets like a hot tub.</p>
