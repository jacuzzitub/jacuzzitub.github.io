<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>

<p>Sure, if your bathroom is too small for a hot tub, or any tub for that matter, you could always choose a massage shower. Install fencing or invest in a sturdy cover that kids can't fall though, even if they step on it. Also, pull up or remove ladders from above-ground models when not in use to prevent children from climbing into the pool or hot tub.

<p>As its name suggests, a swim spa pool is basically a cross between a spa and a swimming pool. But even with limited space, a larger swim spa is still much smaller than a full pool while providing a comfortable experience for a decent number of people. When most people go to buy the spas, the first question they have in mind is the cost and the second question is about the power consumption. Swim Spas actually cost a bit more than a portable hot tub spa and a lot less than an inground swimming pool.</p>
