<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>

However, if you would like all the benefits of hydrotherapy but with more space for swimming, you could consider a pool and spa combo.

If you plan to heat your swim spa regularly, especially the swim end due to the large amount of water, you need to be able to use a gas or a heat pump as the electric heaters will be very expensive.</p>
