<p>By adding another Jet pump you benefit from the maximum therapy experience by adding jets around the body and under the legs. For example, a recent survey of Catalina swim spa reviews led me to discover that Catalina had just ended such a sale as I begin to write this piece, while investigating Michael Phelps swim spa options didn't turn up much of anything where special pricing was concerned. He designed a portable pump that could be fitted inside a bathtub to give the hydro-therapy.</p>

Through the late 80's and the 90's I continued selling and installing primarily inground, or built in” swim spas. Old fashioned hot tub manufacturers and indeed those hot tubs that are not made to the very latest designs and standards use linked, jet-to-jet plumbing systems which can often result in the very first jet in the line being very powerful and the last jet being much less so.</p>
