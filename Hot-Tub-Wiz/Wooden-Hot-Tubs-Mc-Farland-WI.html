<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>After all, Endless Pools pioneered propeller-driven swim-in-place technology in 1988 and has remained the industry-leader for nearly 30 years. When asked What is the largest swim spa?” we tell customers that Hydropool has two of the largest swim spas available on the market. The photo to the left shows the swimming end of the Swim Spa.

<p>A choice that combines Jacuzzi® reliability, quality and value. Spa filters help to remove impurities from the water and ensure your spa pool water is safe for you, your family and friends. In addition, swimming against swim jets is a very different experience to swimming against a natural water current. So if your swim spa's shell structure fails anytime within the 10 year warranty, we replace it. No questions asked.</p>
<p>A good way to locate leaks in your hot tub is by using food coloring and by adding it to the water. Swim Spas are the professional athlete's choice when selecting a swimming pool, and can form an important part of the day-to-day fitness regime of anyone who wants to stay in good shape. Chemicals used to clean and disinfect hot tubs may cause allergic reactions in some people. With three airless swim jets, seating for the family, spa seats with 27 hydromassage jets and plenty of room to move, the R120 sets a new benchmark for quality and value.</p>

<p>While budget swim spas promise a lesser financial burden initially, much more can go wrong if inferior materials and unskilled labor are used. In fact, some swim spas offer more versatility than large pools. In almost all cases the pumps and pipework are all contained under the bath so space shouldn't be a problem unless you're looking for a larger bath.
