<h3>Jacuzzi Hot Tub Specification Guides And Model Information Fairfax Station</h3>
<p>Swim Spas are smaller than typical swimming pools and this makes them much easier to drain for cleaning and maintenance. Between 2000 and 2014, outbreaks from treated pools and hot tubs were linked to more than 27,000 infections and eight deaths in the United States. They are often installed in houses as a replacement for a regular bathtub.

Hot tub pump replacements, parts, impellers, wet ends and seals can be ordered online with quick shipping in order to complete a repair and get the spa working properly again. Swim spas with poor purification systems will require extra money (and time) spent on chemicals.</p>
<p>Smaller 2 person spas normally need more frequent water changes than larger 8 person spas (except if 8 people are using the spa more than twice a week!). A primary reason people buy swim spas is to swim laps without needing a big pool. As larger units were designed to accommodate more people, JacuzziÂ® incorporated heating and filtration systems to keep the water warm and clean, thus creating the first hot tub in 1970.</p>
<p>You can save up on your money and your time by avoiding the prep work that goes into creating enough space for a pool. They will even supply you with the highest quality of hot tub filters. Nowadays, they are more like an item that people just own, with everything from inexpensive inflatable home spas to more expensive classic Jacuzzis.

<p>With the burgeoning interest in health and leisure across the United States, yet another opportunity was spotted in the 1960s, by Roy Jacuzzi, who invented and marketed the first self-contained, fully-integrated whirlpool bath, creating a whole new industry almost on his own.

Tests have proven that through having a heat pump within your spa pool or swim spa, running costs are reduced by over 50%, resulting in shortened and achievable payback period.</p>
