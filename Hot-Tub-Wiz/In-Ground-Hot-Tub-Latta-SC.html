<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>Cedar Mountain Spa Covers prides itself on quality. Yep, you can try out one of our hot tubs for as long as you like. This hydrotherapeutic method will not harm the hot tub although it will take some time for the filters to effectively remove the vinegar from the water. You can eventually have your own swimming spa in front of your house. Hot tubs are said to work therapeutically. The best swim spas are designed so you swim in place against a current, rather than swimming traditional lengths in a pool.</p>

<p>Hot tubs can be manufactured by a variety of brands, and many sport the same high-quality components and advanced features as Jacuzzi products, often for a lower price. This high-powered jet creates a current that is strong enough for a user to swim against, in place of swimming laps. Purchasing the appropriate equipment and exercising maintenance routines are indispensable steps for you to be able to enjoy the benefits of energy efficient concrete pools.</p>
<p>A good way to locate leaks in your hot tub is by using food coloring and by adding it to the water. Swim Spas are the professional athlete's choice when selecting a swimming pool, and can form an important part of the day-to-day fitness regime of anyone who wants to stay in good shape.

<h3>What's The Difference Between A Hot Tub, Jacuzzi And A Spa Latta</h3>
<p>When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>However, you can turn the jets off and just soak, and many swim spas have an area designed just for that - essentially, there is a hot tub area in your spa. It also allows you to use your heat pump to cool the water in summer which is a very valuable benefit. Come and visit our showrooms where you can see our huge range of quality Spas and Swim Spas. If you are unsure as to whether a swim spa or plunge pool would be more applicable to your home or backyard layout and size, speak with our team and allow them to offer their expertise and talk you through our costs and affordable prices.</p>
<p>First this is something that can help you solve a lot of the problems of the day as you take the time to relax in your hot tub at home after a long days drive, or a long day at the office. The portion in which you can swim laps are what makes a swim spa uniquely different from a hot tub alone. For more intensive swimming pool cleaning services, purchase a small, portable pump to remove standing water from the cover.</p>
<p>For decades, the name Jacuzzi” has been synonymous with any contained body of water which includes water jets to aid relaxation. A Swim Spa is essentially an over-sized spa with an added current.

<p>Induced air: The jets may use a venturi effect to incorporate air into the water stream for a lighter massage effect; this requires another set of hoses.
