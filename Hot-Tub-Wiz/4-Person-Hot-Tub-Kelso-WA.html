<p>For anyone looking to get fit there are a multitude of options, but while many people start fitness regimes with the intention of improving their health - particularly in the dark month of January after all that holiday excess - many of these start enthusiastically only to stop within the space of a few weeks. With a variety of lengths, current styles and exercise features, your spa is customized to fit you and your home. Our Swim Spas offer the perfect choice for those who want the best of both: a luxury spa and fully-adjustable swim speed current, all-in-one. The Jacuzzi® brothers invented a pump and a small niche business was born. Its swim spas come in sizes between 1,792 and 2,700 gallons, and there are many jet options to choose from, depending on whether your spa is for family fun, therapy or a thorough workout.</p>
<p>Reviews indicate that the hard resin base gives it better insulation than inflatable hot tubs, but the cover is harder to keep snapped in place. Whether you're simply too busy or feel outnumbered by your troubles, a personal hot tub is an easy way to find peace and comfort without travelling hundreds of miles away. People who have opted for an exercise pool rather than a standard swimming pool find it is much better for exercise plus the running costs are a fraction of those of a large pool.</p>

<p>Every Jacuzzi® hot tub has been researched and engineered to deliver advanced hydrotherapy and with patented jet technology a truly unique hot tub experience. All models have exactly the same seating layout and features, the only difference is the number of swim jets in the swim resistance zone and the overall number of pumps. The Master Spa Parts 8' x 18' cover (94" x 215") Master Spas® swim spa replacement cover is a Master Spa Factory OEM replacement part.</p>

The JACUZZI®J-475 spa features an RX Jet Therapy Lounge with six spinning jets for a Swedish-style hydromassage along the back, coupled with powerful jets aimed to relieve overworked muscles in the legs, feet, neck, and wrists.</p>

<p>2. 24 hour circulation pumps-These pumps function by using a small pump to force water through the heating and filtration system. The ingenuity behind the Endless Pools Swim Machine is just the beginning of the many benefits of owning an Endless Pools Fitness Systems. This is not the case if the spa has a Spa Net” brand controller (fully heat pump compatible). Most people are not duly trained in installing whirlpool tubs so it is strongly advised to hire a contractor for installation.</p>
<p>In case you need something much bigger, SwimEx makes the 1000 S - a multi-user swim spa that holds 7,700 gallons of water.
