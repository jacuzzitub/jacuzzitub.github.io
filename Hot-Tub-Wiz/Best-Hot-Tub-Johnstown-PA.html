<p>The hot tub is an attractive and strong focal point when added as a new feature in a home. Initially, they took to soaking in hot water filled wine barrels and other large wooden vessels and they, logically enough, called these hot tubs. When you use a sauna, jacuzzi, hot tub or steam room, your body is unable to lose heat effectively by sweating. The acidic quality of vinegar eats away at oily residue that has built up in the tub as well as the calcium and other chemical deposits in the jets and tubing.</p>
<p>The Endless Pools Fitness Systems shell has a modern style with clean lines that flow gracefully from end to end. Built from the highest quality acrylic, Endless Pools swim spas are designed to provide years of family fun and enjoyment. The Jacuzzi brother's patent ran out 10 years later in 1976 which lead to the American hot tub market taking off as they were able to use the Jacuzzi type jets. The original hydrotherapy jet was invented by the Jacuzzi® brothers in 1956.</p>

Hot Tub manufactures have improved the jets to give a better hydrotherapeutic effect.
