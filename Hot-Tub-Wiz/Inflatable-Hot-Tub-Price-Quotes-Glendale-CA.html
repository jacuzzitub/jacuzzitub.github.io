<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
<p>The jets are useful for water massage or hydrotherapy. A water current generated by five turbo jets enable swimmers to swim counter current and thus keep fit. If you are hiring a hot tub for that special occasion for a loved one, a small gathering or a large event, hot tubs are a perfect way to make it an event to remember.
