There are hot tubs made for only one, and they go up in size from there. The word spa refers to a tub filled with water that has heat for the water and jets to spray the water and circulate it throughout the tub.</p>
<p>You could, for instance, modify an existing hot tub you may have, adding extra jets to approximate the experience. At Amazon Hot Tubs, our spa technicians take the time to teach you how to maintain safe, crystal clear water using one of our low-chlorine or non-chlorine sanitation systems, and we are always ready to answer any questions you may have about keeping your water in great shape.

<p>Compared to a pool, the ratio of people to volume of water is drastically different to in a spa, prompting unexpected spikes in pH. A jump in pH can cause the water to become alkaline and cloudy, leading to scale build up in your spa. In addition, swimming can be great for runners recovering from injuries since it not only helps maintain good physical health but also improves mental health. The insulation around the cabinet traps in waste heat created by the pumps and heater, greatly increasing the energy efficiency of the swim spa as a whole.</p>
