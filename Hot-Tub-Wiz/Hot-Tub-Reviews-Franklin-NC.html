<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. When hot tubs aren't cleaned well, their moist environment is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Although better than low-end swim spas, many mid-range swim spa swim currents still lack power and smoothness To overcome this, the manufacturer will often include a swim tether system to keep you in place and prevent you from out-swimming the current. Hot tubs are large tubs of hot water that can be used to relax and entertain.</p>
<p>The Indulgence swim spa is the top of the line for us at Sunbelt Spas. Although ABS based acrylic has proven strength, fibreglass is still sometimes added in order to ensure it maintains its strength alongside supporting the spas water and bather load. When your bathroom space is limited, a corner tub can give you the most out of the space. The next big leap forward came when the Jacuzzi brothers hydrotherapy pump was combined with fibreglass bodywork, a filtration system and electric heating system to create what is essentially the modern day hot tub.</p>

<h3>What Are The Dangers Of Children And Hot Tubs Franklin</h3>

<p>The difference with swim spas is that they're often larger than a standard spa pool and have an open area at one end without seating. If an Extreme Lighting Package is installed on your spa, each corner will light up to match the color of light in your hot tub. When you allow the massaging jets to massage your sore spots or even just hold your feet up to the circulating massaging water you will immediately feel better and your feet won't hurt much at all.</p>
