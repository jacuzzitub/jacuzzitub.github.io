<p>Hot tubs have been around since ancient Roman and Greek cultures and in Japan from ancient times right through to today. Swim spas are equipped with a long and narrow tank, similar to that of a swimming pool, but on a smaller scale. More compact than standard above ground swimming pools, swimming against the swim spa's powerful counter-current jets will give even the strongest swimmer an excellent work-out. The understructure of a hot tub will determine how well it can support the weight of the water. While shopping for Jacuzzi tubs, you can do so on by popular collection.</p>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages with such a design because the heat of the sun will be bearing down on you during the day and there is the increased possibility of dirt and debris blowing into the water of the tub. Some Sapphire spas have seats full of jets that we've positioned to target problem areas of the back, neck, and shoulders. They offer a powerful and steady current by using the paddle-wheel devices, jet propulsion, and water that has the speed of 2 and up to 8.5 mph.</p>
<h2>Swim Spa Glen Ellyn Illinois</h2>
<p>One of the most important Jacuzzi tub accessories is the motor that helps run the jets. Our Swim Spa Suite is the perfect option, as it offers the best physical therapy and romantic therapy all wrapped up in one economical spa package. Most swim spas take up less space than traditional small in-ground pools. A hot tub is (usually) a round wooden tank with a simple bench seat and 4-8 jets around the side. The Great Backyard Place also recommends you give plenty of thought to where you want to put the hot tub or swim spa you buy.</p>

Swimming is one of the best methods of building your body's strength and muscle toning, and owning your own swim spa allows you to swim every day without the hassle and running costs of a large, traditional swimming pool, or the expense and effort of visiting a public pool or gym.</p>
<p>Experience the heated-water hydrotherapy and jetted hydromassage benefits of a hot tub, with the increased hydrostatic-pressure benefits of a swim spa. Sure, the waters were colder than I usually like, and my body had to endure a bit of punishment it's not accustomed to (plus, there's shrinkage), but the thrill generated by the competition convinced me that adding open water swims to my racing repertoire is a definite must.</p>
<p>Due to the advanced design and high-grade materials that's used to craft each and every Hydropool Swim Spa, they can offer many years of use. It is smaller than a regular swimming pool, but larger than a spa, so it offers enough space to swim in.

This is why we have designed our swim spas from the ground up to be used all year.</p>
<p>Hot tub covers should always be on the Jacuzzi when not in use, keeping excess dirt and dust out of the water and jets, keep wandering children out of the water (many are lockable) and reducing heat loss to keep your bills as low as possible.
