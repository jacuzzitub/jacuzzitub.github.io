<p>A swim spa is ideal for swimming but did you know that it is an ultimate training machine? A basic model costs about $4,000, while more expensive swim spas, complete with custom features, cost upward of $30,000. Jacuzzi's alcove tubs are installed into a three-wall tiled niche, as the side No. 4 is either a shower curtain or glass shower door. With this you can swim and exercise in your swim spa and you don't even need a pool. Two of the most popular options are spa pools and plunge pools. At , we're proud to work with the leading name in whirlpool baths to stock a great selection of Jacuzzi baths to suit bathrooms big and small.</p>

Jacuzzi's Whisper+ technology features a patented pump system that absorbs half of the vibrations and cuts the tub's heating and pump systems sounds in half. From inflatable hot tubs ideal for small spaces to acrylic tubs meant for the great outdoors (your backyard), we have outlined our picks for most soothing at-home spa solutions based on value and the best price.</p>
