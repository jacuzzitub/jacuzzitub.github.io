<p>Your body opens up the blood vessels because it thinks you are getting too warm and the ones near the surface of the skin relax in an effort to release heat.

Best of all, it helps keep the Jacuzzi bathtub free of bacteria.</p>
<p>Note: Our swim spas are fully plumbed and mechanically assembled, ready for use other than a couple of final connections at the site. But one exercise that never goes out of style is swimming. Swimming is exercise, and with any exercise we are losing moisture from the body - and it is important to replenish this moisture. Clearwater Spas warrants the operating equipment and plumbing against defects in workmanship for five years from the original purchase date.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is now mandatory on public swimming pools in many states in the US. However, a swim spa can be a great addition to your backyard, as it offers the dual benefits of swimming and the spa experience on your own property.
