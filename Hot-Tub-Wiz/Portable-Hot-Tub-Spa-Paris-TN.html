<p>A dip in the warm water of a hot tub can help to soothe tight, sore muscles, and ending a date in the Jacuzzi might allow couples to relax and share intimate time in a whole new way. Medical research is finding that there are many benefits in the use of hot tubs for many people with health problems. If you want to get the most out of our Jacuzzi, the water heater model is right for you. Jacuzzi® is the worldwide leader of hydrotherapy and Spa, and a benchmark for the wellness market. The Jacuzzi Walk in Tubs are shipped from Georgia, Ohio for delivery across North America. Using the 3 jets to swim, the 4 spa seats or just relaxing in the water with just the array of coloured lights tuned on the swim spa is everything and more we expected it to be. Great for exercise and great for relaxing.</p>
<p>Our new jetted swim current lets you exercise with gentle resistance, and then unwind in ergonomically sculpted hydromassage seats. The photo to the left shows the hot tub spa area of an all-in-one Swim Spa unit. You don't need to have the jets or blowers on - there is nothing like laying in your own hot tub, with just your head poking out of the water, watching the sun go down. With a swim spa at home, the incredible benefits of aquatic fitness are delivered right to your doorstep—no traveling, monthly gym membership or navigating a crowded pool filled with strangers.</p>

<p>Deluxe 4-person hot tub with 40 hydrotherapy massage jets and a full body lounge.

<p>A cracked or damaged shell of a hot tub can be very costly or impossible to repair. One of the brothers, Roy Jacuzzi, invented the hot tub in 1968. With powerful massaging jets penetrating deep into the skin, slipping into a swim spa is the answer to instant rejuvenation after a long day, refreshing and revitalizing a tired body and mind. Some manufacturers use full-foam when they make their Hot Tubs and these are in my view and that of very large American manufacturers an old design as they need to be able to vent off the motor-generated heat to the outside air where of course the latent heat contained win in the unit is just simply wasted.</p>
