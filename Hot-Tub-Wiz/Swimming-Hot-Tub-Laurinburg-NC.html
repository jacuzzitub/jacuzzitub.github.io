<p>In our modern, high-tech society, everything gets reviewed these days. Swim spas give you the best environment to let go and focus on learning how to swim. These technologically advanced Swim Spas were developed with input from 23-time gold medalist Michael Phelps and his coach for training, swimming, fitness exercises. At the heart of our strategy is the reduced environmental impact of each of our hot tubs as it operates year after year in your backyard. Bio-film removal and preventing products remove build up in the extensive plumbing lines & jets of the swim spa leading to decreased chlorine use, cleaner filters, better "feel" & increased swimmer comfort.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not about anxiety, it might be that maybe you can't find any good nearby pools or any pools at all. Chlorine and bromine are among the chemicals used to control bacterial growth in hot tub water. To give you a genuine swimming experience the X-Series delivers stronger resistance and less turbulence than ordinary jetted swim spas. We are the largest manufacturer of hot tubs and hydromassage tubs in Europe, with 30 years of experience.</p>
