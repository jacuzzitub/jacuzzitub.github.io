That is why if you notice, the jets are usually positioned at the most stressed muscles of the body - the calves, neck, some at the back, and at the sole of the feet. We favored those that sell spas with paddlewheel current systems, since they're usually the strongest. The bath water is recirculated through the jets, which keeps the water a bit warmer than air being forced in the bath.</p>
<p>This model is also praised for its sturdy construction, as we know that many may find an inflatable hot tub to pose a risk of puncture or leakage, but you can expect this hot tub to stand the test of time in your back garden. Jacuzzi® has a strong reputation within the holiday park, hotel and spa market thanks to their exclusive commercial range. There may also be a hot tub or spa pool and a sauna.
